       "'Discuss the goal of a supply chain and explain the impact of supply chain decisions on the success of a firm.\\nIdentify the three key supply chain decision phases and explain the significance of each one.\\nDescribe the cycle and push/pull views of a supply chain.\\nClassify the supply chain macro processes in a firm.\\nIn this chapter, we provide a conceptual understanding of what a supply chain is and the various issues that need to be considered when designing, planning, or operating a supply chain.\\nWe discuss the significance of supply chain decisions and supply chain performance for the success of a firm.\\nWe also provide several examples from different industries to emphasize the variety of supply chain issues that companies need to consider at the strategic, planning, and operational levels.\\nA supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a customer request.\\nThe supply chain includes not only the manufacturer and suppliers, but also transporters, warehouses, retailers, and even customers themselves.\\nWithin each organization, such as a manufacturer, the supply chain includes all functions involved in receiving and filling a customer request.\\nThese functions include, but are not limited to, new product development, marketing, operations, distribution, finance, and customer service.\\nConsider a customer walking into a Wal-Mart store to purchase detergent.\\nThe supply chain begins with the customer and his or her need for detergent.\\nThe next stage of this supply chain is the Wal-Mart retail store that the customer visits.\\nWal-Mart stocks its shelves using inventory that may have been supplied from a finished-goods warehouse or a distributor using trucks supplied by a third party.\\nThe distributor in turn is stocked by the manufacturer (say, Procter & Gamble [P&G] in this case).\\nThe P&G manufacturing plant receives raw material from a variety of suppliers, who may themselves have been supplied by lower-tier suppliers.\\nFor example, packaging material may come from Pactiv Corporation (formerly Tenneco Packaging) while Pactiv receives raw materials to manufacture the packaging from other suppliers.\\nThis supply chain is illustrated in Figure 1-1, with the arrows corresponding to the direction of physical product flow.\\nTimber Company  Paper  Pactiv  Manufacturer Corporation  P&G or Other Manufacturer  Wal-Mart or Third Party DC  Wal-Mart Store  Customer  Chemical Manufacturer  Plastic Producer  .\\nA supply chain is dynamic and involves the constant flow of information, product, and funds between different stages.\\nIn our example, Wal-Mart provides the product, as well as pricing and availability information, to the customer.\\nThe customer transfers funds to Wal-Mart.\\nWal-Mart conveys point-of-sales data as well as replenishment orders to the warehouse or distributor, who transfers the replenishment order via trucks back to the store.\\nWal-Mart transfers funds to the distributor after the replenishment.\\nThe distributor also provides pricing information and sends delivery schedules to Wal-Mart.\\nWal-Mart may send back packaging material to be recycled.\\nSimilar information, material, and fund flows take place across the entire supply chain.\\nIn another example, when a customer makes a purchase online from Dell Computer, the supply chain includes, among others, the customer, Dell\\'s Web site, the Dell assembly plant, and all of Dell\\'s suppliers and their suppliers.\\nThe Web site provides the customer with information regarding pricing, product variety, and product availability.\\nHaving made a product choice, the customer enters the order information and pays for the product.\\nThe customer may later return to the Web site to check the status of the order.\\nStages further up the supply chain use customer order information to fill the request.\\nThat process involves an additional flow of information, product, and funds among various stages of the supply chain.\\nThese examples illustrate that the customer is an integral part of the supply chain.\\nIn fact, the primary purpose of any supply chain is to satisfy customer needs and, in the process, generate profit for itself.\\nThe term supply chain conjures up images of product or supply moving from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors to retailers to customers along a chain.\\nThis is certainly part of the supply chain, but it is also important to visualize information, funds, and product flows along both directions of this chain.\\nThe term supply chain may also imply that only one player is involved at each stage.\\nIn reality, a manufacturer may receive material from several suppliers and then supply several distributors.\\nThus, most supply chains are actually networks.\\nIt may be more accurate to use the term supply network or supply web to describe the structure of most supply chains, as shown in Figure 1-2.\\nA typical supply chain may involve a variety of stages, including the following: ?Customers ?Retailers ?Wholesalers/distributors ?Manufacturers ?Component/raw material suppliers Each stage in a supply chain is connected through the flow of products, information, and funds.\\nThese flows often occur in both directions and may be managed by one of the stages or an intermediary.\\nSupplier Supplier Supplier  Manufacturer  Distributor  Retailer  Manufacturer  Distributor  Retailer  Manufacturer  Distributor  Retailer  Customer Customer Customer  .\\nEach stage in Figure 1-2 need not be present in a supply chain.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, the appropriate design of the supply chain depends on both the customer\\'s needs and the roles played by the stages involved.\\nFor example, Dell has two supply chain structures that it uses to serve its customers.\\nFor its corporate clients and also some individuals who want a customized personal computer (PC), Dell builds to order; that is, a customer order initiates manufacturing at Dell.\\nFor these customers, Dell does not have a separate retailer, distributor, or wholesaler in the supply chain.\\nSince 2007, Dell has also sold its PCs through Wal-Mart in the United States and the GOME Group, China\\'s largest electronics retailer.\\nBoth Wal-Mart and the GOME Group carry Dell machines in inventory.\\nThis supply chain thus contains an extra stage (the retailer) compared to the direct sales model also used by Dell.\\nIn the case of other retail stores, the supply chain may also contain a wholesaler or distributor between the store and the manufacturer.\\nThe objective of every supply chain should be to maximize the overall value generated.\\nThe value (also known as supply chain surplus) a supply chain generates is the difference between what the value of the final product is to the customer and the costs the supply chain incurs in filling the customer\\'s request.\\nSupply Chain Surplus = Customer Value ?Supply Chain Cost The value of the final product may vary for each customer and can be estimated by the maximum amount the customer is willing to pay for it.\\nThe difference between the value of the product and its price remains with the customer as consumer surplus.\\nThe rest of the supply chain surplus becomes supply chain profitability, the difference between the revenue generated from the customer and the overall cost across the supply chain.\\nFor example, a customer purchasing a wireless router from Best Buy pays $60, which represents the revenue the supply chain receives.\\nCustomers who purchase the router clearly value it at or above $60.\\nThus, part of the supply chain surplus is left with the customer as consumer surplus.\\nThe rest stays with the supply chain as profit.\\nBest Buy and other stages of the supply chain incur costs to convey information, produce components, store them, transport them, transfer funds, and so on.\\nThe difference between the $60 that the customer paid and the sum of all costs incurred by the supply chain to produce and distribute the router represents the supply chain profitability.\\nSupply chain profitability is the total profit to be shared across all supply chain stages and intermediaries.\\nThe higher the supply chain profitability, the more successful is the supply chain.\\nFor most profit-making supply chains, the supply chain surplus will be strongly correlated with profits.\\nSupply chain success should be measured in terms of supply chain profitability and not in terms of the profits at an individual stage.\\n(In subsequent chapters, we see that a focus on profitability at individual stages may lead to a reduction in overall supply chain profits.)\\nA focus on growing the supply chain surplus pushes all members of the supply chain toward growing the size of the overall pie.\\nHaving defined the success of a supply chain in terms of supply chain profitability, the next logical step is to look for sources of value, revenue, and cost.\\nFor any supply chain, there is only one source of revenue: the customer.\\nThe value obtained by a customer purchasing detergent at Wal-Mart depends upon several factors, including the functionality of the detergent, how far the customer has to travel to Wal-Mart, and the likelihood of finding the detergent in stock.\\nThe customer is the only one providing positive cash flow for the Wal-Mart supply chain.\\nAll other cash flows are simply fund exchanges that occur within the supply chain, given that different stages have different owners.\\nWhen Wal-Mart pays its supplier, it is taking a portion of the funds the customer provides and passing that money on to the supplier.\\nAll flows of information, product, or funds generate costs within the supply chain.\\nThus, the appropriate management of these flows is a key to supply chain success.\\nEffective supply chain management involves the management of supply chain assets and product, information, and fund flows to maximize total supply chain surplus.\\nA growth in supply chain surplus increases the size of the total pie, allowing contributing members of the supply chain to benefit.\\nIn this book, we have a strong focus on analyzing all supply chain decisions in terms of their impact on the supply chain surplus.\\nThese decisions and their impact can vary for a wide variety of reasons.\\nFor instance, consider the difference in the supply chain structure for fast-moving consumer goods observed in the United States and India.\\nU.S. distributors play a much smaller role in this supply chain compared to their Indian counterparts.\\nWe argue that the difference in supply chain structure can be explained by the impact a distributor has on the supply chain surplus in the two countries.\\nRetailing in the United States is largely consolidated, with large chains buying consumer goods from most manufacturers.\\nThis consolidation gives retailers sufficient scale that the introduction of an intermediary such as a distributor does little to reduce costs and may actually increase costs because of an additional transaction.\\nIn contrast, India has millions of small retail outlets.\\nThe small size of Indian retail outlets limits the amount of inventory they can hold, thus requiring frequent replenishment--an order can be compared with the weekly grocery shopping for a family in the United States.\\nThe only way for a manufacturer to keep transportation costs low is to bring full truckloads of product close to the market and then distribute locally using \"milk runs\" with smaller vehicles.\\nThe presence of an intermediary who can receive a full truckload shipment, break bulk, and then make smaller deliveries to the retailers is crucial if transportation costs are to be kept low.\\nMost Indian distributors are one-stop shops, stocking everything from cooking oil to soaps and detergents made by a variety of manufacturers.\\nBesides the convenience provided by one-stop shopping, distributors in India are also able to reduce transportation costs for outbound delivery to the retailer by aggregating products across multiple manufacturers during the delivery runs.\\nDistributors in India also handle collections, because their cost of collection is significantly lower than that of each manufacturer collecting from retailers on its own would be.\\nThus, the important role of distributors in India can be explained by the growth in supply chain surplus that results from their presence.\\nThe supply chain surplus argument implies that as retailing in India begins to consolidate, the role of distributors will diminish.\\nThere is a close connection between the design and management of supply chain flows (product, information, and funds) and the success of a supply chain.\\nWal-Mart, Amazon, and Seven-Eleven Japan are examples of companies that have built their success on superior design, planning, and  .\\noperation of their supply chain.\\nIn contrast, the failure of many online businesses such as Webvan can be attributed to weaknesses in their supply chain design and planning.\\nThe rise and subsequent fall of the bookstore chain Borders illustrates how a failure to adapt its supply chain to a changing environment and customer expectations hurt its performance.\\nDell Computer is another example of a company that had to revise its supply chain design in response to changing technology and customer needs.\\nWe discuss these examples later in this section.\\nWal-Mart has been a leader at using supply chain design, planning, and operation to achieve success.\\nFrom its beginning, the company invested heavily in transportation and information infrastructure to facilitate the effective flow of goods and information.\\nWal-Mart designed its supply chain with clusters of stores around distribution centers to facilitate frequent replenishment at its retail stores in a cost-effective manner.\\nFrequent replenishment allows stores to match supply and demand more effectively than the competition.\\nWal-Mart has been a leader in sharing information and collaborating with suppliers to bring down costs and improve product availability.\\nThe results are impressive.\\nIn its 2010 annual report, the company reported a net income of more than $14.3 billion on revenues of about $408 billion.\\nThese are dramatic results for a company that reached annual sales of only $1 billion in 1980.\\nThe growth in sales represents an annual compounded growth rate of more than 20 percent.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan is another example of a company that has used excellent supply chain design, planning, and operation to drive growth and profitability.\\nIt has used a very responsive replenishment system along with an outstanding information system to ensure that products are available at each of its convenience stores to match customer needs.\\nIts responsiveness allows it to change the merchandising mix at each store by time of day to precisely match customer demand.\\nAs a result, the company has grown from sales of 1 billion yen in 1974 to almost 3 trillion yen in 2009 with profits in 2009 totaling 164 billion yen.\\nThe failure of many online businesses such as Webvan and Kozmo can be attributed to their inability to design appropriate supply chains or manage supply chain flows effectively.\\nWebvan designed a supply chain with large warehouses in several major cities in the United States, from which groceries were delivered to customers\\' homes.\\nThis supply chain design could not compete with traditional supermarket supply chains in terms of cost.\\nTraditional supermarket chains bring product to a supermarket close to the consumer using full truckloads, resulting in very low transportation costs.\\nThey turn their inventory relatively fast and let the customer perform most of the picking activity in the store.\\nIn contrast, Webvan turned its inventory marginally faster than supermarkets but incurred much higher transportation costs for home delivery and high labor costs to pick customer orders.\\nThe result was a company that folded in 2001 within two years of a very successful initial public offering.\\nAs the experience of Borders illustrates, a failure to adapt supply chains to a changing environment can significantly hurt performance.\\nBorders, along with Barnes & Noble, dominated the selling of books and music in the 1990s by implementing the superstore concept.\\nCompared to small local bookstores that dominated the industry prior to that, Borders was able to offer greater variety (about 100,000 titles at superstores relative to fewer than 10,000 titles at a local bookstore) to customers at a lower cost by aggregating operations in large stores.\\nThis allowed the company to achieve higher inventory turns than local bookstores with lower operating costs per dollar of sales.\\nIn 2004, Borders achieved sales of almost $4 billion with profits of $132 million.\\nIts model, however, was already under attack with the growth of Amazon, which offered much greater variety than Borders at lower cost by selling online and stocking its inventories in a few distribution centers.\\nBorders inability to adapt its supply chain to compete with Amazon led to a rapid decline.\\nBy 2009, sales had dropped to $2.8 billion and the company lost $109 million that year.\\nDell is another example of a company that enjoyed tremendous success based on its supply chain design, planning, and operation but then had to adapt its supply chain in response to shifts in technology and customer expectations.\\nBetween 1993 and 2006, Dell experienced unprecedented growth of both revenue and profits by structuring a supply chain  5  .\\nKey Point Supply chain design, planning, and operation decisions play a significant role in the success or failure of a firm.\\nTo stay competitive, supply chains must adapt to changing technology and customer expectations.\\nthat provided customers with customized PCs quickly and at reasonable cost.\\nBy 2006, Dell had a net income of more than $3.5 billion on revenues of just over $56 billion.\\nThis success was based on two key supply chain features that supported rapid, low-cost customization.\\nThe first was Dell\\'s decision to sell directly to the end customer, bypassing distributors and retailers.\\nThe second key aspect of Dell\\'s supply chain was the centralization of manufacturing and inventories in a few locations where final assembly was postponed until the customer order arrived.\\nAs a result, Dell was able to provide a large variety of PC configurations while keeping low levels of component inventories.\\nIn spite of this tremendous success, the changing marketplace presented some new challenges for Dell.\\nWhereas Dell\\'s supply chain was well suited for highly customized PCs, the market shifted to lower levels of customization.\\nGiven the growing power of hardware, customers were satisfied with a few model types.\\nDell reacted by adjusting its supply chain with regard to both direct selling and building to order.\\nThe company started selling its PCs through retail chains such as Wal-Mart in the United States and GOME in China.\\nIt also outsourced a large fraction of its assembly to low-cost locations, effectively building to stock rather than to customer order.\\nUnlike Borders, Dell is making a significant effort to adapt its supply chain to changing times.\\nIt remains to be seen whether these changes will improve Dell\\'s performance.\\nIn the next section, we categorize supply chain decision phases based on the frequency with which they are made and the time frame they take into account.\\nSuccessful supply chain management requires many decisions relating to the flow of information, product, and funds.\\nEach decision should be made to raise the supply chain surplus.\\nThese decisions fall into three categories or phases, depending on the frequency of each decision and the time frame during which a decision phase has an impact.\\nAs a result, each category of decisions must consider uncertainty over the decision horizon.\\nSupply Chain Strategy or Design: During this phase, a company decides how to structure the supply chain over the next several years.\\nIt decides what the chain\\'s configuration will be, how resources will be allocated, and what processes each stage will perform.\\nStrategic decisions made by companies include whether to outsource or perform a supply chain function in-house, the location and capacities of production and warehousing facilities, the products to be manufactured or stored at various locations, the modes of transportation to be made available along different shipping legs, and the type of information system to be utilized.\\nPepsiCo Inc.\\'s decision in 2009 to purchase two of its largest bottlers is a supply chain design or strategic decision.\\nA firm must ensure that the supply chain configuration supports its strategic objectives and increases the supply chain surplus during this phase.\\nAs the PepsiCo CEO announced in a news release on August 4, \"while the existing model has served the system very well, the fully integrated beverage business will enable us to bring innovative products and packages to market faster, streamline our manufacturing and distribution systems and react more quickly to  .\\nchanges in the marketplace.\"\\nSupply chain design decisions are typically made for the long term (a matter of years) and are expensive to alter on short notice.\\nConsequently, when companies make these decisions, they must take into account uncertainty in anticipated market conditions over the next few years.\\nSupply Chain Planning: For decisions made during this phase, the time frame considered is a quarter to a year.\\nTherefore, the supply chain\\'s configuration determined in the strategic phase is fixed.\\nThis configuration establishes constraints within which planning must be done.\\nThe goal of planning is to maximize the supply chain surplus that can be generated over the planning horizon given the constraints established during the strategic or design phase.\\nCompanies start the planning phase with a forecast for the coming year (or a comparable time frame) of demand and other factors such as costs and prices in different markets.\\nPlanning includes making decisions regarding which markets will be supplied from which locations, the subcontracting of manufacturing, the inventory policies to be followed, and the timing and size of marketing and price promotions.\\nFor example, steel giant ArcelorMittal\\'s decisions regarding markets supplied by a production facility and target production quantities at each location are classified as planning decisions.\\nPlanning establishes parameters within which a supply chain will function over a specified period of time.\\nIn the planning phase, companies must include uncertainty in demand, exchange rates, and competition over this time horizon in their decisions.\\nGiven a shorter time frame and better forecasts than in the design phase, companies in the planning phase try to incorporate any flexibility built into the supply chain in the design phase and exploit it to optimize performance.\\nAs a result of the planning phase, companies define a set of operating policies that govern short-term operations.\\nSupply Chain Operation: The time horizon here is weekly or daily.\\nDuring this phase, companies make decisions regarding individual customer orders.\\nAt the operational level, supply chain configuration is considered fixed, and planning policies are already defined.\\nThe goal of supply chain operations is to handle incoming customer orders in the best possible manner.\\nDuring this phase, firms allocate inventory or production to individual orders, set a date that an order is to be filled, generate pick lists at a warehouse, allocate an order to a particular shipping mode and shipment, set delivery schedules of trucks, and place replenishment orders.\\nBecause operational decisions are being made in the short term (minutes, hours, or days), there is less uncertainty about demand information.\\nGiven the constraints established by the configuration and planning policies, the goal during the operation phase is to exploit the reduction of uncertainty and optimize performance.\\nThe design, planning, and operation of a supply chain have a strong impact on overall profitability and success.\\nIt is fair to state that a large part of the success of firms such as Wal-Mart and Seven-Eleven Japan can be attributed to their effective supply chain design, planning, and operation.\\nIn later chapters, we develop concepts and present methodologies that can be used at each of the three decision phases described earlier.\\nMost of our discussion addresses the supply chain design and planning phases.\\n7  Key Point Supply chain decision phases may be categorized as design, planning, or operational, depending on the time frame during which the decisions made apply.\\nDesign decisions constrain or enable good planning, which in turn constrains or enables effective operation.\\nA supply chain is a sequence of processes and flows that take place within and between different stages and combine to fill a customer need for a product.\\nThere are two ways to view the processes performed in a supply chain.\\nCycle View: The processes in a supply chain are divided into a series of cycles, each performed at the interface between two successive stages of a supply chain.\\nPush/Pull View: The processes in a supply chain are divided into two categories depending on whether they are executed in response to a customer order or in anticipation of customer orders.\\nPull processes are initiated by a customer order, whereas push processes are initiated and performed in anticipation of customer orders.\\nCycle View of Supply Chain Processes Given the five stages of a supply chain as shown in Figure 1-2, all supply chain processes can be broken down into the following four process cycles, as shown in Figure 1-3: ?Customer order cycle ?Replenishment cycle ?Manufacturing cycle ?Procurement cycle Each cycle occurs at the interface between two successive stages of the supply chain.\\nNot every supply chain will have all four cycles clearly separated.\\nFor example, a grocery supply chain in which a retailer stocks finished-goods inventories and places replenishment orders with a distributor is likely to have all four cycles separated.\\nDell, in contrast, bypasses the retailer and distributor when it sells directly to customers.\\nCustomer  Customer Order Cycle  Retailer  Replenishment Cycle Distributor  Manufacturing Cycle  Manufacturer  Procurement Cycle Supplier  .\\nSupplier stage markets product Buyer stage places order  .\\nBuyer returns reverse flows to supplier or third party Buyer stage receives supply  Supplier stage receives order  Supplier stage supplies order  .\\nEach cycle consists of six subprocesses as shown in Figure 1-4.\\nEach cycle starts with the supplier marketing the product to customers.\\nA buyer then places an order that is received by the supplier.\\nThe supplier supplies the order, which is received by the buyer.\\nThe buyer may return some of the product or other recycled material to the supplier or a third party.\\nThe cycle of activities then begins all over again.\\nDepending on the transaction in question, the subprocesses in Figure 1-4 can be applied to the appropriate cycle.\\nWhen customers shop online at Amazon, they are part of the customer order cycle--with the customer as the buyer and Amazon as the supplier.\\nIn contrast, when Amazon orders books from a distributor to replenish its inventory, it is part of the replenishment cycle-- with Amazon as the buyer and the distributor as the supplier.\\nWithin each cycle, the goal of the buyer is to ensure product availability and to achieve economies of scale in ordering.\\nThe supplier attempts to forecast customer orders and reduce the cost of receiving the order.\\nThe supplier then works to fill the order on time and improve efficiency and accuracy of the order fulfillment process.\\nThe buyer then works to reduce the cost of the receiving process.\\nReverse flows are managed to reduce cost and meet environmental objectives.\\nEven though each cycle has the same basic subprocesses, there are a few important differences among the cycles.\\nIn the customer order cycle, demand is external to the supply chain and thus uncertain.\\nIn all other cycles, order placement is uncertain but can be projected based on policies followed by the particular supply chain stage.\\nFor example, in the procurement cycle, a tire supplier to an automotive manufacturer can predict tire demand precisely once the production schedule at the manufacturer is known.\\nThe second difference across cycles relates to the scale of an order.\\nWhereas a customer buys a single car, the dealer orders multiple cars at a time from the manufacturer, and the manufacturer, in turn, orders an even larger quantity of tires from the supplier.\\nAs we move from the customer to the supplier, the number of individual orders declines and the size of each order increases.\\nThus, sharing of information and operating policies across supply chain stages becomes more important as we move further from the end customer.\\nA cycle view of the supply chain is useful when considering operational decisions because it clearly specifies the roles of each member of the supply chain.\\nThe detailed process description of a supply chain in the cycle view forces a supply chain designer to consider the infrastructure required to support these processes.\\nThe cycle view is useful, for example, when setting up information systems to support supply chain operations.\\nKey Point A cycle view of the supply chain clearly defines the processes involved and the owners of each process.\\nThis view is useful when considering operational decisions because it specifies the roles and responsibilities of each member of the supply chain and the desired outcome for each process.\\nPush/Pull View of Supply Chain Processes All processes in a supply chain fall into one of two categories depending on the timing of their execution relative to end customer demand.\\nWith pull processes, execution is initiated in response to a customer order.\\nWith push processes, execution is initiated in anticipation of customer orders based on a forecast.\\nPull processes may also be referred to as reactive processes because they react to customer demand.\\nPush processes may also be referred to as speculative processes because they respond to speculated (or forecasted) rather than actual demand.\\nThe push/pull boundary in a supply chain separates push processes from pull processes as shown in Figure 1-5.\\nPush processes operate in an uncertain environment because customer demand is not yet known.\\nPull processes operate in an environment in which customer demand is known.\\nThey are, however, often constrained by inventory and capacity decisions that were made in the push phase.\\nLet us compare a make-to-stock environment like that of L. L. Bean and a build-to-order environment like that of Dell to compare the push/pull view and the cycle view.\\nL. L. Bean executes all processes in the customer order cycle after the customer order arrives.\\nAll processes that are part of the customer order cycle are thus pull processes.\\nOrder fulfillment takes place from product in inventory that is built up in anticipation of customer orders.\\nThe goal of the replenishment cycle is to ensure product availability when a customer order arrives.\\nAll processes in the replenishment cycle are performed in anticipation of demand and are thus push processes.\\nThe same holds true for processes in the manufacturing and procurement cycles.\\nIn fact, raw material such as fabric is often purchased six to nine months before customer demand is expected.\\nManufacturing itself begins three to six months before the point of sale.\\nThe processes in the L. L. Bean supply chain break up into pull and push processes, as shown in Figure 1-6.\\nPush/Pull Boundary  Push Processes Process Process Process 1 23  Pull Processes  Process Process k k1  Process Process N1 N  .\\nCustomer Order Cycle Procurement, Manufacturing, Replenishment Cycles  PULL PROCESSES Customer Order Arrives PUSH PROCESSES  .\\nCustomer Order Cycle L. L. Bean Replenishment and Manufacturing Cycle Manufacturer Procurement Cycle  .\\nSupplier  For the PCs it sells through Wal-Mart, Dell\\'s order cycles and its push/pull boundary look like that of L. L. Bean with Wal-Mart as the retailer instead of L. L. Bean and Dell as the manufacturer.\\nThe situation is different when Dell builds customized computers to order for its customers.\\nIn this case, the arrival of a customer order triggers production of the product.\\nThe manufacturing cycle is thus part of the customer order fulfillment process in the customer order cycle.\\nThere are effectively only two cycles in the Dell supply chain for customized PCs: (1) a customer order and manufacturing cycle and (2) a procurement cycle, as shown in Figure 1-7.\\nAll processes in the customer order and manufacturing cycle at Dell are thus classified as pull processes because they are initiated by customer order arrival.\\nDell, however, does not place component orders in response to a customer order.\\nInventory is replenished in anticipation  Customer Order and Manufacturing Cycle Procurement Cycle  PULL PROCESSES  Customer Order Arrives PUSH PROCESSES  Customer Order and Manufacturing Cycle Procurement Cycle  .\\nKey Point A push/pull view of the supply chain categorizes processes based on whether they are initiated in response to a customer order (pull) or in anticipation of a customer order (push).\\nThis view is useful when considering strategic decisions relating to supply chain design.\\nAll processes in the procurement cycle for Dell are thus classified as push processes, because they are in response to a forecast.\\nFor build-to-order PCs, the processes in the Dell supply chain break up into pull and push processes as shown in Figure 1-7.\\nA push/pull view of the supply chain is very useful when considering strategic decisions relating to supply chain design.\\nThe goal is to identify an appropriate push/pull boundary such that the supply chain can match supply and demand effectively.\\nThe paint industry provides another excellent example of the gains from suitably adjusting the push/pull boundary.\\nThe manufacture of paint requires production of the base, mixing of suitable colors, and packing.\\nUntil the 1980s, all these processes were performed in large factories, and paint cans were shipped to stores.\\nThese qualified as push processes, as they were performed to a forecast in anticipation of customer demand.\\nGiven the uncertainty of demand, the paint supply chain had great difficulty matching supply and demand.\\nIn the 1990s, paint supply chains were restructured such that mixing of colors was done at retail stores after customers placed their orders.\\nIn other words, color mixing was shifted from the push to the pull phase of the supply chain even though base preparation and packing of cans were still performed in the push phase.\\nThe result is that customers are always able to get the color of their choice, while total paint inventories across the supply chain have declined.\\nSupply Chain Macro Processes in a Firm All supply chain processes discussed in the two process views and throughout this book can be classified into the following three macro processes, as shown in Figure 1-8: 1.\\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM): all processes that focus on the interface between the firm and its customers 2.\\nInternal Supply Chain Management (ISCM): all processes that are internal to the firm 3.\\nSupplier Relationship Management (SRM): all processes that focus on the interface between the firm and its suppliers  Supplier  Firm  SRM  ISCM  ?Source ?Negotiate ?Buy ?Design Collaboration ?Supply Collaboration  ?Strategic Planning ?Demand Planning ?Supply Planning ?Fulfillment ?Field Service  .\\nCustomer CRM ?Market ?Price ?Sell ?Call Center ?Order Management  .\\nKey Point Within a firm, all supply chain activities belong to one of three macro processes: CRM, ISCM, and SRM.\\nIntegration among the three macro processes is crucial for successful supply chain management.\\nThese three macro processes manage the flow of information, product, and funds required to generate, receive, and fulfill a customer request.\\nThe CRM macro process aims to generate customer demand and facilitate the placement and tracking of orders.\\nIt includes processes such as marketing, pricing, sales, order management, and call center management.\\nAt an industrial distributor such as W.W. Grainger, CRM processes include the preparation of catalogs and other marketing materials, management of the Web site, and management of the call center that takes orders and provides service.\\nThe ISCM macro process aims to fulfill demand generated by the CRM process in a timely manner and at the lowest possible cost.\\nISCM processes include the planning of internal production and storage capacity, preparation of demand and supply plans, and fulfillment of actual orders.\\nAt W.W. Grainger, ISCM processes include planning for the location and size of warehouses; deciding which products to carry at each warehouse; preparing inventory management policies; and picking, packing, and shipping actual orders.\\nThe SRM macro process aims to arrange for and manage supply sources for various goods and services.\\nSRM processes include the evaluation and selection of suppliers, negotiation of supply terms, and communication regarding new products and orders with suppliers.\\nAt W.W. Grainger, SRM processes include the selection of suppliers for various products, negotiation of pricing and delivery terms with suppliers, sharing of demand and supply plans with suppliers, and the placement of replenishment orders.\\nObserve that all three macro processes are aimed at serving the same customer.\\nFor a supply chain to be successful, it is crucial that the three macro processes are well integrated.\\nThe importance of this integration is discussed in Chapters 10 and 17.\\nThe organizational structure of the firm has a strong influence on the success or failure of the integration effort.\\nIn many firms, marketing is in charge of the CRM macro process, manufacturing handles the ISCM macro process, and purchasing oversees the SRM macro process--with little communication among them.\\nIt is not unusual for marketing and manufacturing to have different forecasts when making their plans.\\nThis lack of integration hurts the supply chain\\'s ability to match supply and demand effectively, leading to dissatisfied customers and high costs.\\nThus, firms should structure a supply chain organization that mirrors the macro processes and ensures good communication and coordination among the owners of processes that interact with one another.\\n1.6 EXAMPLES OF SUPPLY CHAINS In this section, we consider several supply chains and raise questions that must be answered during their design, planning, and operation phases.\\nIn later chapters, we discuss concepts and present methodologies that can be used to answer these questions.\\nGateway and Apple: Two Different Journeys into Retailing Gateway was founded in 1985 as a direct sales manufacturer of PCs with no retail footprint.\\nIn 1996, Gateway was one of the first PC manufacturers to start selling PCs online.\\nAfter many years of selling its PCs without a retail infrastructure, Gateway introduced an aggressive strategy of opening Gateway retail stores throughout the United States in the late 1990s.\\nIts stores carried no finished-goods inventory and were primarily focused on helping customers select the right configuration to purchase.\\nAll PCs were manufactured to order and shipped to the customer from one of the assembly plants.\\nInitially, investors rewarded Gateway for this strategy and raised the stock price to more than $80 per share in late 1999.\\nHowever, this success did not last.\\nBy November 2002, Gateway shares had dropped to less than $4, and Gateway was losing a significant amount of money.\\nBy April 2004, Gateway had closed all its retail outlets and reduced the number of configurations offered to customers.\\nIn August 2007, Gateway was purchased by Taiwan\\'s Acer for a price of $710 million.\\nBy 2010, Gateway computers were sold through more than 20 different retail outlets including Best Buy and Costco.\\nAs you can imagine, this was quite a transition for the company to experience.\\nIn contrast, Apple has enjoyed tremendous success since it opened its first retail store in 2001.\\nBy 2010, Apple had more than 300 stores worldwide, and retail sales represented about 15 percent of the company\\'s total net sales.\\nUnlike Gateway, Apple has always carried product inventory at its stores.\\nGiven its product designs, Apple has relatively little variety that it carries in its stores.\\nEach of its stores has a relatively high level of sales with its Regent Street store in London reaching sales of 2,000 pounds per square foot in 2009.\\nIn the 2010 annual report, Apple listed retail sales totaling almost $10 billion, a growth of 47 percent relative to the previous year.\\nThe following questions highlight supply chain decisions that have a bearing on the difference between Apple\\'s and Gateway\\'s performance: 1.\\nWhy did Gateway choose not to carry any finished-product inventory at its retail stores?\\nWhy did Apple choose to carry inventory at its stores?\\nShould a firm with an investment in retail stores carry any finished-goods inventory?\\nWhat are the characteristics of products that are most suitable to be carried in finished-goods inventory?\\nWhat characterizes products that are best manufactured to order?\\nHow does product variety affect the level of inventory a retail store must carry?\\nIs a direct selling supply chain without retail stores always less expensive than a supply chain with retail stores?\\nWhat factors explain the success of Apple retail and the failure of Gateway country stores?\\nZara: Apparel Manufacturing and Retail Zara is a chain of fashion stores owned by Inditex, Spain\\'s largest apparel manufacturer and retailer.\\nIn 2009, Inditex reported sales of about 11 billion euros from more than 4,700 retail outlets in about 76 countries.\\nIn an industry in which customer demand is fickle, Zara has grown rapidly with a strategy to be highly responsive to changing trends with affordable prices.\\nWhereas design-to-sales cycle times in the apparel industry have traditionally averaged more than six months, Zara has achieved cycle times of four to six weeks.\\nThis speed allows Zara to introduce new designs every week and to change 75 percent of its merchandise display every three to four weeks.\\nThus, Zara\\'s products on display match customer preferences much more closely than the competition.\\nThe result is that Zara sells most of its products at full price and has about half the markdowns in its stores compared to the competition.\\nZara manufactures its apparel using a combination of flexible and quick sources in Europe (mostly Portugal and Spain) and low-cost sources in Asia.\\nThis contrasts with most apparel manufacturers, who have moved most of their manufacturing to Asia.\\nAbout 40 percent of the manufacturing capacity is owned by Inditex, with the rest outsourced.\\nProducts with highly uncertain demand are sourced out of Europe, whereas products that are more predictable are sourced from its Asian locations.\\nMore than 40 percent of its finished-goods purchases and most of its in-house production occur after the sales season starts.\\nThis compares with less than 20 percent production after the start of a sales season for a typical retailer.\\nThis responsiveness and the postponement of decisions until after trends are known allow Zara to reduce inventories and forecast error.\\nZara has also invested heavily in information technology to ensure that the latest sales data are available to drive replenishment and production decisions.\\nIn 2009, Inditex distributed to stores all over the world from eight distribution centers located in Spain.\\nThe group claimed an average delivery time of 24 hours for European stores and up to a maximum of 48 hours for stores in America or Asia from the time the order was  .\\nreceived in the distribution center (DC) to the time it was delivered to the stores.\\nShipments from the DCs to stores were made several times a week.\\nThis allowed store inventory to closely match customer demand.\\nThe following questions raise supply chain issues that are central to Zara\\'s strategy and success: 1.\\nWhat advantage does Zara gain against the competition by having a very responsive supply chain?\\nWhy has Inditex chosen to have both in-house manufacturing and outsourced manufacturing?\\nWhy has Inditex maintained manufacturing capacity in Europe even though manufacturing in Asia is much cheaper?\\nWhy does Zara source products with uncertain demand from local manufacturers and products with predictable demand from Asian manufacturers?\\nWhat advantage does Zara gain from replenishing its stores multiple times a week compared to a less frequent schedule?\\nHow does the frequency of replenishment affect the design of its distribution system?\\nDo you think Zara\\'s responsive replenishment infrastructure is better suited for online sales or retail sales?\\nW.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr: MRO Suppliers W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr sell maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) products.\\nBoth companies have catalogs and Web pages through which orders can be placed.\\nW.W. Grainger also has several hundred stores throughout the United States.\\nCustomers can walk into a store, call in an order, or place it via the Web.\\nW.W. Grainger orders are either shipped to the customer or picked up by the customer at one of its stores.\\nMcMaster-Carr, on the other hand, ships almost all its orders (though a few customers near its DCs do pick up their own orders).\\nW.W. Grainger has nine DCs that both replenish stores and fill customer orders.\\nMcMaster has five DCs from which all orders are filled.\\nNeither McMaster nor W.W. Grainger manufactures any product.\\nThey primarily serve the role of a distributor or retailer.\\nTheir success is largely linked to their supply chain management ability.\\nBoth firms offer several hundred thousand products to their customers.\\nGrainger stocks about 200,000 stock-keeping units (SKU), whereas McMaster carries about 500,000.\\nGrainger also provides many other products that it does not stock direct from its suppliers.\\nBoth firms face the following strategic and operational issues: 1.\\nHow many DCs should be built and where should they be located?\\nHow should product stocking be managed at the DCs?\\nShould all DCs carry all products?\\nWhat products should be carried in inventory and what products should be left with the supplier to be shipped directly in response to a customer order?\\nWhat products should W.W. Grainger carry at a store?\\nHow should markets be allocated to DCs in terms of order fulfillment?\\nWhat should be done if an order cannot be completely filled from a DC?\\nShould there be specified backup locations?\\nHow should they be selected?\\nHow should replenishment of inventory be managed at the various stocking locations?\\nHow should Web orders be handled relative to the existing business?\\nIs it better to integrate the Web business with the existing business or to set up separate distribution?\\nWhat transportation modes should be used for order fulfillment and stock replenishment?\\nToyota: A Global Auto Manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation is Japan\\'s top auto manufacturer and has experienced significant growth in global sales over the past two decades.\\nA key issue facing Toyota is the design of its global production and distribution network.\\nPart of Toyota\\'s global strategy is to open factories in every market it serves.\\nToyota must decide what the production capability of each of the  .\\nfactories will be, as this has a significant impact on the desired distribution system.\\nAt one extreme, each plant can be equipped only for local production.\\nAt the other extreme, each plant is capable of supplying every market.\\nPrior to 1996, Toyota used specialized local factories for each market.\\nAfter the Asian financial crisis in 1996/1997, Toyota redesigned its plants so that it could also export to markets that remain strong when the local market weakens.\\nToyota calls this strategy \"global complementation.\"\\nWhether to be global or local is also an issue for Toyota\\'s parts plants and product design.\\nShould parts plants be built for local production or should there be few parts plants globally that supply multiple assembly plants?\\nToyota has worked hard to increase commonality in parts used around the globe.\\nWhile this helped the company lower costs and improve parts availability, common parts caused significant difficulty when one of the parts had to be recalled.\\nIn 2009, Toyota had to recall about 12 million cars using common parts across North America, Europe and Asia causing significant damage to the brand as well as the finances.\\nAny global manufacturer like Toyota must address the following questions regarding the configuration and capability of the supply chain: 1.\\nWhere should the plants be located and what degree of flexibility should be built into each?\\nWhat capacity should each plant have?\\nShould plants be able to produce for all markets or only specific contingency markets?\\nHow should markets be allocated to plants and how frequently should this allocation be revised?\\nWhat kind of flexibility should be built into the distribution system?\\nHow should this flexible investment be valued?\\nWhat actions may be taken during product design to facilitate this flexibility?\\nAmazon: Online Sales Amazon sells books, music, and many other items over the Internet and is one of the pioneers of online consumer sales.\\nAmazon, based in Seattle, Washington, started by filling all orders using books purchased from a distributor in response to customer orders.\\nAs it grew, the company added warehouses, allowing it to react more quickly to customer orders.\\nIn 2009, Amazon had about 20 warehouses in the United States and another 30 in the rest of the world.\\nPostal Service and other package carriers such as UPS and FedEx to send products to customers.\\nOutbound shipping-related costs at Amazon in 2009 were almost $2 billion.\\nWith the Kindle, Amazon has worked hard to increase sales of digital books.\\nAs of 2009, Amazon offered more than 460,000 books in digital form.\\nThe company has also added a significant amount of audio and video content for sale in digital form.\\nAmazon has continued to expand the set of products that it sells online.\\nBesides books and music, Amazon has added many product categories such as toys, apparel, electronics, jewelry, and shoes.\\nIn 2009, one of its largest acquisitions was Zappos, a leader in online shoe sales.\\nThis acquisition added a lot of product variety.\\nAccording to the Amazon annual report, this required creating 121,000 product descriptions and uploading more than 2.2 million images to the Web site!\\nIn 2010, another interesting acquisition by Amazon was diapers.com.\\nUnlike Zappos, this acquisition added little variety but considerable shipping volumes.\\nSeveral questions arise concerning how Amazon is structured and the product categories it continues to add: 1.\\nWhy is Amazon building more warehouses as it grows?\\nHow many warehouses should it have and where should they be located?\\nWhat advantages does selling books via the Internet provide over a traditional bookstore?\\nAre there any disadvantages to selling via the Internet?\\nShould Amazon stock every product it sells?\\nWhat advantage can bricks-and-mortar players derive from setting up an online channel?\\nHow should they use the two channels to gain maximum advantage?\\nWhat advantages/disadvantages does the online channel enjoy in the sale of shoes /diapers relative to a retail store?\\nFor what products does the online channel offer the greater advantage relative to retail stores?\\nWhat characterizes these products?\\n1.7 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.\\nDiscuss the goal of a supply chain and explain the impact of supply chain decisions on the success of a firm.\\nThe goal of a supply chain should be to maximize overall supply chain surplus.\\nSupply chain surplus is the difference between the value generated for the customer and the total cost incurred across all stages of the supply chain.\\nA focus on the supply chain surplus grows the size of the overall pie for all members of the supply chain.\\nSupply chain decisions have a large impact on the success or failure of each firm because they significantly influence both the revenue generated and the cost incurred.\\nSuccessful supply chains manage flows of product, information, and funds to provide a high level of product availability to the customer while keeping costs low.\\nIdentify the three key supply chain decision phases and explain the significance of each one.\\nSupply chain decisions may be characterized as strategic (design), planning, or operational, depending on the time period during which they apply.\\nStrategic decisions relate to supply chain configuration.\\nThese decisions have a long-term impact lasting several years.\\nPlanning decisions cover a period of a few months to a year and include decisions such as production plans, subcontracting, and promotions over that period.\\nOperational decisions span from minutes to days and include sequencing production and filling specific orders.\\nStrategic decisions define the constraints for planning decisions, and planning decisions define the constraints for operational decisions.\\nDescribe the cycle and push/pull views of a supply chain.\\nA cycle view of a supply chain divides processes into cycles, each performed at the interface between two successive stages of a supply chain.\\nEach cycle starts with an order placed by one stage of the supply chain and ends when the order is received from the supplier stage.\\nA push/pull view of a supply chain characterizes processes based on their timing relative to that of a customer order.\\nPull processes are performed in response to a customer order, whereas push processes are performed in anticipation of customer orders.\\nClassify the supply chain macro processes in a firm.\\nAll supply chain processes can be classified into three macro processes based on whether they are at the customer or supplier interface or are internal to the firm.\\nThe CRM macro process consists of all processes at the interface between the firm and the customer that work to generate, receive, and track customer orders.\\nThe ISCM macro process consists of all supply chain processes that are internal to the firm and work to plan for and fulfill customer orders.\\nThe SRM macro process consists of all supply chain processes at the interface between the firm and its suppliers that work to evaluate and select suppliers and then source goods and services from them.\\n Explain why achieving strategic fit is critical to a company\\'s overall success.\\nDescribe how a company achieves strategic fit between its supply chain strategy and its competitive strategy.\\nDiscuss the importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit across the supply chain.\\nDescribe the major challenges that must be overcome to manage a supply chain successfully.\\nIn Chapter 1, we discussed what a supply chain is and the importance of supply chain design, planning, and operation to a firm\\'s success.\\nIn this chapter, we define supply chain strategy and explain how creating a strategic fit between a company\\'s competitive strategy and its supply chain strategy affects performance.\\nWe also discuss the importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit from one operation within a company to all stages of the supply chain.\\nA company\\'s competitive strategy defines, relative to its competitors, the set of customer needs that it seeks to satisfy through its products and services.\\nFor example, Wal-Mart aims to provide high availability of a variety of products of reasonable quality at low prices.\\nMost products sold at Wal-Mart are commonplace (everything from home appliances to clothing) and can be purchased elsewhere.\\nWhat Wal-Mart provides is a low price and product availability.\\nMcMaster-Carr sells maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) products.\\nIt offers more than 500,000 products through both a catalog and a Web site.\\nIts competitive strategy is built around providing the customer with convenience, availability, and responsiveness.\\nWith this focus on responsiveness, McMaster does not compete based on low price.\\nClearly, the competitive strategy at Wal-Mart is different from that at McMaster.\\nWe can also contrast Blue Nile, with its online retailing model for diamonds, with Zales, which sells diamond jewelry through retail outlets.\\nBlue Nile has emphasized the variety of diamonds available from its Web site and the fact that its margins are significantly lower than its bricks-and-mortar competition.\\nCustomers, however, have to wait to get their jewelry and do not have any opportunity to touch and see it before purchase (Blue Nile does provide a 30-day return period).\\nAt Zales, in contrast, a customer can walk into the retail store, be helped by a salesperson, and leave immediately with a diamond ring.\\nThe amount of variety available at a Zales store, however, is limited.\\nWhereas Blue Nile offers more than 70,000 stones on its site, a typical Zales store carries less than a thousand.\\nIn each case, the competitive strategy is defined based on how the customer prioritizes product cost, delivery time, variety, and quality.\\nA McMaster-Carr customer places greater emphasis on product variety and response  19  .\\nFinance, Accounting, Information Technology, Human Resources  New Product Development  Marketing and Sales  Operations Distribution Service  .\\nA Wal-Mart customer, in contrast, places greater emphasis on cost.\\nA Blue Nile customer, purchasing online, places great emphasis on product variety and cost.\\nA customer purchasing jewelry at Zales is most concerned with fast response time and help in product selection.\\nThus, a firm\\'s competitive strategy will be defined based on its customers\\' priorities.\\nCompetitive strategy targets one or more customer segments and aims to provide products and services that satisfy these customers\\' needs.\\nTo see the relationship between competitive and supply chain strategies, we start with the value chain for a typical organization, as shown in Figure 2-1.\\nThe value chain begins with new product development, which creates specifications for the product.\\nMarketing and sales generate demand by publicizing the customer priorities that the products and services will satisfy.\\nMarketing also brings customer input back to new product development.\\nUsing new product specifications, operations transforms inputs to outputs to create the product.\\nDistribution either takes the product to the customer or brings the customer to the product.\\nService responds to customer requests during or after the sale.\\nThese are core processes or functions that must be performed for a successful sale.\\nFinance, accounting, information technology, and human resources support and facilitate the functioning of the value chain.\\nTo execute a company\\'s competitive strategy, all these functions play a role, and each must develop its own strategy.\\nHere, strategy refers to what each process or function will try to do particularly well.\\nA product development strategy specifies the portfolio of new products that a company will try to develop.\\nIt also dictates whether the development effort will be made internally or outsourced.\\nA marketing and sales strategy specifies how the market will be segmented and how the product will be positioned, priced, and promoted.\\nA supply chain strategy determines the nature of procurement of raw materials, transportation of materials to and from the company, manufacture of the product or operation to provide the service, and distribution of the product to the customer, along with any follow-up service and a specification of whether these processes will be performed in-house or outsourced.\\nSupply chain strategy specifies what the operations, distribution, and service functions, whether performed in-house or outsourced, should do particularly well.\\nBecause our focus here is on supply chain strategy, we define it in more detail.\\nSupply chain strategy includes a specification of the broad structure of the supply chain and what many traditionally call \"supplier strategy,\" \"operations strategy,\" and \"logistics strategy.\"\\nFor example, Dell\\'s initial decision to sell direct, its 2007 decision to start selling PCs through resellers, and Cisco\\'s decision to use contract manufacturers define the broad structure of their supply chains and are all part of their supply chain strategies.\\nSupply chain strategy also includes design decisions regarding inventory, transportation, operating facilities, and information flows.\\nFor example, Amazon\\'s decisions to build warehouses to stock some products and to continue using distributors as a source of other products are part of its supply chain strategy.\\nSimilarly, Toyota\\'s decision to have production facilities in each of its major markets is part of its supply chain strategy.\\nFor a firm to succeed, all functional strategies must support one another and the competitive strategy.\\nFor example, Seven-Eleven Japan\\'s success can be related to the excellent fit among its functional strategies.\\nMarketing at Seven-Eleven has emphasized convenience in the form of easy  .\\naccess to stores and availability of a wide range of products and services.\\nNew product development at Seven-Eleven is constantly adding products and services, such as bill payment services that draw customers in and exploit the excellent information infrastructure and the fact that customers frequently visit Seven-Eleven.\\nOperations and distribution at Seven-Eleven have focused on having a high density of stores, being very responsive, and providing an excellent information infrastructure.\\nThe result is a virtuous cycle in which supply chain infrastructure is exploited to offer new products and service that increase demand, and the increased demand in turn makes it easier for operations to improve the density of stores, responsiveness in replenishment, and the information infrastructure.\\nIn the next section, we elaborate on this notion of fit and seek to answer this question: Given its competitive strategy, what should a company\\'s supply chain try to do particularly well?\\nStrategic fit requires that both the competitive and supply chain strategies of a company have aligned goals.\\nIt refers to consistency between the customer priorities that the competitive strategy hopes to satisfy and the supply chain capabilities that the supply chain strategy aims to build.\\nFor a company to achieve strategic fit, it must accomplish the following: 1.\\nThe competitive strategy and all functional strategies must fit together to form a coordinated overall strategy.\\nEach functional strategy must support other functional strategies and help a firm reach its competitive strategy goal.\\nThe different functions in a company must appropriately structure their processes and resources to be able to execute these strategies successfully.\\nThe design of the overall supply chain and the role of each stage must be aligned to support the supply chain strategy.\\nA company may fail either because of a lack of strategic fit or because its overall supply chain design, processes, and resources do not provide the capabilities to support the desired strategic fit.\\nConsider, for example, a situation in which marketing is publicizing a company\\'s ability to provide a large variety of products quickly; simultaneously, distribution is targeting the lowest cost means of transportation.\\nIn this situation, it is likely that distribution will delay orders so it can get better transportation economies by grouping orders together or using inexpensive but slow modes of transportation.\\nThis action conflicts with marketing\\'s stated goal of providing variety quickly.\\nSimilarly, consider a scenario in which a retailer has decided to provide a high level of variety while carrying low levels of inventory but has selected suppliers and carriers based on their low price and not their responsiveness.\\nIn this case, the retailer is likely to end up with unhappy customers because of poor product availability.\\nTo elaborate on strategic fit, let us consider the evolution of Dell and its supply chain.\\nBetween 1993 and 2006, Dell\\'s competitive strategy was to provide a large variety of customizable products at a reasonable price.\\nGiven the focus on customization, Dell\\'s supply chain was designed to be very responsive.\\nAssembly facilities owned by Dell were designed to be flexible and to easily handle the wide variety of configurations requested by customers.\\nA facility that focused on low cost and efficiency by producing large volumes of the same configuration would not have been appropriate in this setting.\\nThe notion of strategic fit also extended to other functions within Dell.\\nDell PCs were designed to use common components and to allow rapid assembly.\\nThis design strategy clearly aligned well with the supply chain\\'s goal of assembling customized PCs in response to customer orders.\\nDell worked hard to carry this alignment to its suppliers.\\nGiven that Dell produced customized products with low levels of inventory, it was crucial that suppliers and carriers be highly responsive.\\nFor example, the ability of carriers to merge a PC from Dell with a monitor from Sony allowed Dell not to carry any Sony monitors in inventory.\\nStarting in 2007, however, Dell altered its competitive strategy and supply chain.\\nWhile it continued to offer customization, the company also branched out into selling PCs through retail stores such as Wal-Mart.\\nThe assortment at retail, however, is very different from the focus on customization in the direct sales channel.\\nThrough Wal-Mart, Dell offers a limited variety of desktops and laptops.\\nIt is also essential that monitors and other peripherals be available in inventory because a customer buying a PC at Wal-Mart is not willing to wait for the monitor to show up later.\\nClearly, the flexible and responsive supply chain that aligns well with customer needs for customization does not necessarily align well when customers no longer want customization but prefer low prices.\\nThis raises the question of how Dell should adjust the various functional strategies given the change in competitive strategy if it is to maintain strategic fit.\\nOne of Dell\\'s initial responses has been to not build everything to order and increase its reliance on contract manufacturers based in low-cost countries for assembly.\\nHow Is Strategic Fit Achieved?\\nWhat does a company need to do to achieve that all-important strategic fit between the supply chain and competitive strategies?\\nA competitive strategy will specify, either explicitly or implicitly, one or more customer segments that a company hopes to satisfy.\\nTo achieve strategic fit, a company must ensure that its supply chain capabilities support its ability to satisfy the needs of the targeted customer segments.\\nThere are three basic steps to achieving this strategic fit, which we outline here and then discuss in more detail: 1.\\nUnderstanding the Customer and Supply Chain Uncertainty: First, a company must understand the customer needs for each targeted segment and the uncertainty these needs impose on the supply chain.\\nThese needs help the company define the desired cost and service requirements.\\nThe supply chain uncertainty helps the company identify the extent of the unpredictability of demand, disruption, and delay that the supply chain must be prepared for.\\nUnderstanding the Supply Chain Capabilities: Each of the many types of supply chains is designed to perform different tasks well.\\nA company must understand what its supply chain is designed to do well.\\nAchieving Strategic Fit: If a mismatch exists between what the supply chain does particularly well and the desired customer needs, the company will either need to restructure the supply chain to support the competitive strategy or alter its competitive strategy.\\nSTEP 1: UNDERSTANDING THE CUSTOMER AND SUPPLY CHAIN UNCERTAINTY To understand the customer, a company must identify the needs of the customer segment being served.\\nLet us compare Seven-Eleven Japan and a discounter such as Sam\\'s Club (a part of Walmart).\\nWhen customers go to Seven-Eleven to purchase detergent, they go there for the convenience of a nearby store and are not necessarily looking for the lowest price.\\nIn contrast, low price is very important to a Sam\\'s Club customer.\\nThis customer may be willing to tolerate less variety and even purchase large package sizes as long as the price is low.\\nEven though customers purchase detergent at both places, the demand varies along certain attributes.\\nIn the case of Seven-Eleven, customers are in a hurry and want convenience.\\nIn the case of Sam\\'s Club, they want a low price and are willing to spend time getting it.\\nIn general, customer demand from different segments varies along several attributes as follows: ?The Quantity of the Product Needed in Each Lot: An emergency order for material needed to repair a production line is likely to be small.\\nAn order for material to construct a new production line is likely to be large.\\n?The Response Time That Customers Are Willing to Tolerate: The tolerable response time for the emergency order is likely to be short, whereas the allowable response time for the construction order is apt to be long.\\n?The Variety of Products Needed: A customer may place a high premium on the availability of all parts of an emergency repair order from a single supplier.\\nThis may not be the case for the construction order.\\n?The Service Level Required: A customer placing an emergency order expects a high level of product availability.\\nThis customer may go elsewhere if all parts of the order are not immediately available.\\nThis is not apt to happen in the case of the construction order, for which a long lead time is likely.\\n?The Price of the Product: The customer placing the emergency order is apt to be much less sensitive to price than the customer placing the construction order.\\n?The Desired Rate of Innovation in the Product: Customers at a high-end department store expect a lot of innovation and new designs in the store\\'s apparel.\\nCustomers at Walmart may be less sensitive to new product innovation.\\nEach customer in a particular segment will tend to have similar needs, whereas customers in a different segment can have very different needs.\\nAlthough we have described the many attributes along which customer demand varies, our goal is to identify one key measure for combining all of these attributes.\\nThis single measure then helps define what the supply chain should do particularly well.\\nImplied Demand Uncertainty.\\nAt first glance, it may appear that each of the customer need categories should be viewed differently, but in a fundamental sense, each customer need can be translated into the metric of implied demand uncertainty, which is demand uncertainty imposed on the supply chain because of the customer needs it seeks to satisfy.\\nWe make a distinction between demand uncertainty and implied demand uncertainty.\\nDemand uncertainty reflects the uncertainty of customer demand for a product.\\nImplied demand uncertainty, in contrast, is the resulting uncertainty for only the portion of the demand that the supply chain plans to satisfy based on the attributes the customer desires.\\nFor example, a firm supplying only emergency orders for a product will face a higher implied demand uncertainty than a firm that supplies the same product with a long lead time, as the second firm has an opportunity to fulfill the orders evenly over the long lead time.\\nAnother illustration of the need for this distinction is the impact of service level.\\nAs a supply chain raises its level of service, it must be able to meet a higher and higher percentage of actual demand, forcing it to prepare for rare surges in demand.\\nThus, raising the service level increases the implied demand uncertainty even though the product\\'s underlying demand uncertainty does not change.\\nBoth the product demand uncertainty and various customer needs that the supply chain tries to fill affect implied demand uncertainty.\\nTable 2-1 illustrates how various customer needs affect implied demand uncertainty.\\nTable 2-1 Impact of Customer Needs on Implied Demand Uncertainty  Customer Need  Causes Implied Demand Uncertainty to...\\nRange of quantity required increases Lead time decreases Variety of products required increases Number of channels through which product may be acquired increases Rate of innovation increases Required service level increases  Increase because a wider range of the quantity required implies greater variance in demand Increase because there is less time in which to react to orders Increase because demand per product becomes more disaggregate Increase because the total customer demand is now disaggregated over more channels Increase because new products tend to have more uncertain demand Increase because the firm now has to handle unusual surges in demand  .\\nTable 2-2 Correlation Between Implied Demand Uncertainty and Other Attributes  Low Implied Uncertainty  High Implied Uncertainty  Product margin Average forecast error Average stockout

Fisher, Harvard Business Review (March耍pril 1997), 83?3.\\nAs each individual customer need contributes to the implied demand uncertainty, we can use implied demand uncertainty as a common metric with which to distinguish different types of demand.\\nFisher (1997) pointed out that implied demand uncertainty is often correlated with other characteristics of demand, as shown in Table 2-2.\\nAn explanation follows: 1.\\nProducts with uncertain demand are often less mature and have less direct competition.\\nAs a result, margins tend to be high.\\nForecasting is more accurate when demand has less uncertainty.\\nIncreased implied demand uncertainty leads to increased difficulty in matching supply with demand.\\nFor a given product, this dynamic can lead to either a stockout or an oversupply situation.\\nIncreased implied demand uncertainty thus leads to both higher oversupply and a higher stockout rate.\\nMarkdowns are high for products with greater implied demand uncertainty because oversupply often results.\\nFirst, let us take an example of a product with low implied demand uncertainty--such as table salt.\\nSalt has a low margin, accurate demand forecasts, low stockout rates, and virtually no markdowns.\\nThese characteristics match well with Fisher\\'s chart of characteristics for products with highly certain demand.\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, a new cell phone has high implied demand uncertainty.\\nIt will likely have a high margin, inaccurate demand forecasts, high stockout rates (if it is successful), and large markdowns (if it is a failure).\\nThis too matches well with Table 2-2.\\nLee (2002) pointed out that along with demand uncertainty, it is important to consider uncertainty resulting from the capability of the supply chain.\\nFor example, when a new component is introduced in the PC industry, the quality yields of the production process tend to be low and breakdowns are frequent.\\nAs a result, companies have difficulty delivering according to a well-defined schedule, resulting in high supply uncertainty for PC manufacturers.\\nAs the production technology matures and yields improve, companies are able to follow a fixed delivery schedule, resulting in low supply uncertainty.\\nTable 2-3 illustrates how various characteristics of supply sources affect the supply uncertainty.\\nTable 2-3 Impact of Supply Source Capability on Supply Uncertainty  Supply Source Capability  Causes Supply Uncertainty to...\\nFrequent breakdowns Unpredictable and low yields Poor quality Limited supply capacity Inflexible supply capacity Evolving production process  Increase Increase Increase Increase Increase Increase  Source: Adapted from \"Aligning Supply Chain Strategies with Product Uncertainties.\"\\nHau L.

not every firm is able to operate on the efficient frontier, which represents the costresponsiveness performance of the best supply chains.\\nA firm that is not on the efficient frontier can improve both its responsiveness and its cost performance by moving toward the efficient frontier.\\nIn contrast, a firm on the efficient frontier can improve its responsiveness only by increasing cost and becoming less efficient.\\nSuch a firm must then make a trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness.\\nOf course, firms on the efficient frontier are also continuously improving their processes and changing technology to shift the efficient frontier itself.\\nGiven the trade-off between cost and responsiveness, a key strategic choice for any supply chain is the level of responsiveness it seeks to provide.\\nSupply chains range from those that focus solely on being responsive to those that focus on a goal of producing and supplying at the lowest possible cost.\\nFigure 2-4 shows the responsiveness spectrum and where some supply chains fall on this spectrum.\\nThe more capabilities constituting responsiveness a supply chain has, the more responsive it is.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan replenishes its stores with breakfast items in the morning, lunch items in the afternoon, and dinner items at night.\\nAs a result, the available product variety changes by time of day.\\nSeven-Eleven responds quickly to orders, with store managers placing replenishment orders less than 12 hours before they are supplied.\\nThis practice makes the Seven-Eleven supply chain very responsive.\\nAnother example of a responsive supply chain is W.W. Grainger.\\nThe company faces both demand and supply uncertainty; therefore, the supply chain has been designed to deal effectively with both to provide customers with a wide variety of MRO products within 24 hours.\\nAn efficient supply chain, in contrast, lowers cost by eliminating some of its responsive capabilities.\\nFor example, Sam\\'s Club sells a limited variety of products in large package sizes.\\nThe supply chain is capable of low costs, and the focus of this supply chain is clearly on efficiency.\\nResponsiveness High  Low High  Cost  Low  .\\nHighly efficient  Somewhat efficient  .\\nSomewhat responsive  Highly responsive  Integrated steel mills: Production scheduled weeks or months in advance with little variety or flexibility  Hanes apparel: A traditional make-tostock manufacturer with production lead time of several weeks  .\\nMost automotive production: Delivering a large variety of products in a couple of weeks  Seven-Eleven Japan: Changing merchandise mix by location and time of day  Key Point The second step in achieving strategic fit between competitive and supply chain strategies is to understand the supply chain and map it on the responsiveness spectrum.\\nSTEP 3: ACHIEVING STRATEGIC FIT After mapping the level of implied uncertainty and understanding the supply chain position on the responsiveness spectrum, the third and final step is to ensure that the degree of supply chain responsiveness is consistent with the implied uncertainty.\\nThe goal is to target high responsiveness for a supply chain facing high implied uncertainty, and efficiency for a supply chain facing low implied uncertainty.\\nFor example, the competitive strategy of McMaster-Carr targets customers who value having a large variety of MRO products delivered to them within 24 hours.\\nGiven the large variety of products and rapid desired delivery, demand from McMaster-Carr customers can be characterized as having high implied demand uncertainty.\\nMcMaster-Carr has the option of designing an efficient or responsive supply chain.\\nAn efficient supply chain may carry less inventory and maintain a level load on the warehouse to lower picking and packing costs.\\nIf McMaster-Carr made these choices, it would have difficulty supporting the customer\\'s desire for a wide variety of products that are delivered within 24 hours.\\nTo serve its customers effectively, McMaster-Carr carries a high level of inventory and picking and packing capacity.\\nClearly, a responsive supply chain is better suited to meet the needs of customers targeted by McMaster-Carr even if it results in higher costs.\\nNow, consider a pasta manufacturer such as Barilla.\\nPasta is a product with relatively stable customer demand, giving it a low implied demand uncertainty.\\nSupply is also quite predictable.\\nBarilla could design a highly responsive supply chain in which pasta is custom made in small batches in response to customer orders and shipped via a rapid transportation mode such as FedEx.\\nThis choice would obviously make the pasta prohibitively expensive, resulting in a loss of customers.\\nBarilla therefore is in a much better position if it designs a more efficient supply chain with a focus on cost reduction.\\nFrom the preceding discussion, it follows that increasing implied uncertainty from customers and supply sources is best served by increasing responsiveness from the supply chain.\\nThis relationship is represented by the \"zone of strategic fit\" illustrated in Figure 2-5.\\nFor a high level of performance, companies should move their competitive strategy (and resulting implied uncertainty) and supply chain strategy (and resulting responsiveness) toward the zone of strategic fit.\\nResponsive Supply Chain  Responsiveness Spectrum  ZSotrnaeteogfic Fit  Efficient Supply Chain Certain Demand  Implied Uncertainty Spectrum  .\\nUncertain Demand  The next step in achieving strategic fit is to assign roles to different stages of the supply chain that ensure the appropriate level of responsiveness.\\nIt is important to understand that the desired level of responsiveness required across the supply chain may be attained by assigning different levels of responsiveness and efficiency to each stage of the supply chain as illustrated by the following examples.\\nIKEA is a Swedish furniture retailer with large stores in more than 20 countries.\\nIKEA has targeted customers who want stylish furniture at a reasonable cost.\\nThe company limits the variety of styles that it sells through modular design.\\nThe large scale of each store and the limited variety of furniture (through modular design) decrease the implied uncertainty faced by the supply chain.\\nIKEA stocks all styles in inventory and serves customers from stock.\\nThus, it uses inventory to absorb all the uncertainty faced by the supply chain.\\nThe presence of inventory at large IKEA stores allows replenishment orders to its manufacturers to be more stable and predictable.\\nAs a result, IKEA passes along little uncertainty to its manufacturers, who tend to be located in lowcost countries and focus on efficiency.\\nIKEA provides responsiveness in the supply chain, with the stores absorbing most of the uncertainty and being responsive, and the suppliers absorbing little uncertainty and being efficient.\\nIn contrast, another approach for responsiveness may involve the retailer holding little inventory.\\nIn this case, the retailer does not contribute significantly to supply chain responsiveness, and most of the implied demand uncertainty is passed on to the manufacturer.\\nFor the supply chain to be responsive, the manufacturer now needs to be flexible and have low response times.\\nAn example of this approach is England, Inc., a furniture manufacturer located in Tennessee.\\nEvery week, the company makes several thousand sofas and chairs to order, delivering them to furniture stores across the country within three weeks.\\nEngland Inc.\\'s retailers allow customers to select from a wide variety of styles and promise relatively quick delivery.\\nThis imposes a high level of implied uncertainty on the supply chain.\\nThe retailers, however, do not carry much inventory and pass most of the implied uncertainty on to England, Inc.\\nThe retailers can thus be efficient because most of the implied uncertainty for the supply chain is absorbed by England, Inc., with its flexible manufacturing process.\\nEngland, Inc., itself has a choice of how much uncertainty it passes along to its suppliers.\\nBy holding more raw material inventories, the company allows its suppliers to focus on efficiency.\\nIf it decreases its raw material inventories, its suppliers must become more responsive.\\nSupplier absorbs the least implied uncertainty and must be very efficient.\\nManufacturer absorbs less implied uncertainty and must be somewhat efficient.\\nRetailer absorbs most of the implied uncertainty and must be very responsive.\\nSupplier Manufacturer Retailer  Supply Chain I  Extent of Implied Uncertainty for the Supply Chain  Supplier Manufacturer Retailer  Supply Chain II  Supplier absorbs less implied uncertainty and must be somewhat efficient.\\nManufacturer absorbs most of the implied uncertainty and must be very responsive.\\nRetailer absorbs the least implied uncertainty and must be very efficient.\\nThe preceding discussion illustrates that the supply chain can achieve a given level of responsiveness by adjusting the roles of each of its stage.\\nMaking one stage more responsive allows other stages to focus on becoming more efficient.\\nThe best combination of roles depends on the efficiency and flexibility available at each stage.\\nThe notion of achieving a given level of responsiveness by assigning different roles and levels of uncertainty to different stages of the supply chain is illustrated in Figure 2-6.\\nThe figure shows two supply chains that face the same implied uncertainty but achieve the desired level of responsiveness with different allocations of uncertainty and responsiveness across the supply chain.\\nSupply Chain I has a very responsive retailer who absorbs most of the uncertainty, allowing (actually requiring) the manufacturer and supplier to be efficient.\\nSupply Chain II, in contrast, has a very responsive manufacturer who absorbs most of the uncertainty, thus allowing the other stages to focus on efficiency.\\nTo achieve complete strategic fit, a firm must also ensure that all its functions maintain consistent strategies that support the competitive strategy.\\nAll functional strategies must support the goals of the competitive strategy.\\nAll substrategies within the supply chain--such as manufacturing, inventory, and purchasing--must also be consistent with the supply chain\\'s level of responsiveness.\\nTable 2-4 lists some of the major differences in functional strategy between supply chains that are efficient and those that are responsive.\\nKey Point The final step in achieving strategic fit is to match supply chain responsiveness with the implied uncertainty from demand and supply.\\nThe supply chain design and all functional strategies within the firm must also support the supply chain\\'s level of responsiveness.\\nTable 2-4 Comparison of Efficient and Responsive Supply Chains  Efficient Supply Chains  Responsive Supply Chains  Primary goal Product design strategy Pricing strategy Manufacturing

Supply Chain for Your Product?\"\\nMarshall L. Fisher, Harvard Business Review (March耍pril 1997), 83?3.\\nTailoring the Supply Chain for Strategic Fit Our previous discussion focused on achieving strategic fit when a firm serves a single market segment and the result is a well-defined and narrow strategic position.\\nWhile such a scenario holds for firms like IKEA, many firms are required to achieve strategic fit while serving many customer segments with a variety of products across multiple channels.\\nIn such a scenario, a \"one size fits all\" supply chain cannot provide strategic fit, and a tailored supply chain strategy is required.\\nFor example, when all its customers valued having customized PCs delivered within days, Dell built a responsive supply chain that aligned well with its strategic position.\\nAs Dell added the Wal-Mart channel, whose customers valued low price, its responsive supply chain no longer aligned with this new channel.\\nDell had to design a more efficient supply chain that was tailored to serve the low-cost channel using contract manufacturers in low-cost countries.\\nAnother example is Levi Strauss, which sells both customized and standard-sized jeans.\\nDemand for standard-sized jeans has a much lower demand uncertainty than demand for customized jeans.\\nAs a result, Levi Strauss must tailor its supply chain to meet both sets of needs.\\nIn each of the previous examples, the products sold and the customer segments served have different implied demand uncertainty.\\nWhen devising supply chain strategy in these cases, the key issue for a company is to design a tailored supply chain that is able to be efficient when implied uncertainty is low and responsive when it is high.\\nBy tailoring its supply chain, a company can provide responsiveness to fast-growing products, customer segments, and channels while maintaining low cost for mature, stable products and customer segments.\\nTailoring the supply chain requires sharing some links in the supply chain with some products, while having separate operations for other links.\\nThe links are shared to achieve maximum possible efficiency while providing the appropriate level of responsiveness to each segment.\\nFor instance, all products may be made on the same line in a plant, but products requiring a high level of responsiveness may be shipped using a fast mode of transportation such as FedEx.\\nThose products that do not have high responsiveness needs may be sent by slower and less expensive means such as truck, rail, or even ship.\\nIn other instances, products requiring high responsiveness may be manufactured using a flexible process, whereas products requiring less responsiveness may be manufactured using a less responsive but more efficient process.\\nThe mode of transportation used in both cases, however, may be the same.\\nIn other cases, some products may be held at regional warehouses close to the customer, whereas others may be held in a centralized warehouse far from  .\\nW.W. Grainger holds fast-moving items with low implied uncertainty in its decentralized locations close to the customer.\\nIt holds slow-moving items with higher implied demand uncertainty in a centralized warehouse.\\nAppropriate tailoring of the supply chain helps a firm achieve varying levels of responsiveness for a low overall cost.\\nThe level of responsiveness is tailored to each product, channel, or customer segment.\\nTailoring of the supply chain is an important concept that we develop further in subsequent chapters.\\nThe concept of tailoring to achieve strategic fit is important in industries such as high-tech and pharmaceuticals wherein innovation is critical and products move through a life cycle.\\nLet us consider changes in demand and supply characteristics over the life cycle of a product.\\nToward the beginning stages of a product\\'s life cycle: 1.\\nDemand is very uncertain, and supply may be unpredictable.\\nMargins are often high, and time is crucial to gaining sales.\\nProduct availability is crucial to capturing the market.\\nCost is often a secondary consideration.\\nConsider a pharmaceutical firm introducing a new drug.\\nInitial demand for the drug is highly uncertain, margins are typically high, and product availability is the key to capturing market share.\\nThe introductory phase of a product\\'s life cycle corresponds to high implied uncertainty given the high demand uncertainty and the need for a high level of product availability.\\nIn such a situation, responsiveness is the most important characteristic of the supply chain.\\nAs the product becomes a commodity product later in its life cycle, the demand and supply characteristics change.\\nAt this stage, it is typically the case that 1.\\nDemand has become more certain, and supply is predictable.\\nMargins are lower as a result of an increase in competitive pressure.\\nPrice becomes a significant factor in customer choice.\\nIn the case of a pharmaceutical company, these changes occur when demand for the drug stabilizes, production technologies are well developed, and supply is predictable.\\nThis stage corresponds to a low level of implied uncertainty.\\nAs a result, the supply chain needs to change.\\nIn such a situation, efficiency becomes the most important characteristic of the supply chain.\\nThe pharmaceutical industry has reacted by building a mix of flexible and efficient capacity whose use is tailored to the product life cycle.\\nNew products are typically introduced using flexible capacity that is more expensive but responsive enough to deal with the high level of uncertainty during the early stages of the life cycle.\\nMature products with high demand are shifted to dedicated capacity that is highly efficient because it handles low levels of uncertainty and enjoys the advantage of high scale.\\nThe tailored capacity strategy has allowed pharmaceutical firms to maintain strategic fit for a wide range of products at different stages of their life cycle.\\nIn the next section, we describe how the scope of the supply chain has expanded when achieving strategic fit.\\nWe also discuss why expanding the scope of strategic fit is critical to supply chain success.\\nKey Point When supplying multiple customer segments with a wide variety of products through several channels, a firm must tailor its supply chain to achieve strategic fit.\\nA key issue relating to strategic fit is the scope, in terms of supply chain stages, across which the strategic fit applies.\\nScope of strategic fit refers to the functions within the firm and stages across the supply chain that devise an integrated strategy with an aligned objective.\\nAt one extreme, every operation within each functional area devises its own independent strategy with the objective of optimizing its individual performance.\\nIn this case, the scope of strategic fit is restricted to an operation in a functional area within a stage of the supply chain.\\nAt the opposite extreme, all functional areas across all stages of the supply chain devise aligned strategies that maximize supply chain surplus.\\nIn this case, the scope of strategic fit extends to the entire supply chain.\\nIn this section, we discuss how expanding the scope of strategic fit improves supply chain performance.\\nFor example, IKEA has achieved great success by expanding its scope of strategic fit to include all functions and stages within the supply chain.\\nIts competitive strategy is to offer a reasonable variety of home furniture and furnishings at low prices.\\nIts stores are large and carry all products in inventory.\\nIts products are designed to be modular and easy to assemble.\\nThe large stores and modular design allow IKEA to move final assembly and lastmile delivery (two high-cost operations) to the customer.\\nAs a result, all functions within the IKEA supply chain focus on efficiency.\\nIts suppliers concentrate on producing large volumes of a few modules at low cost.\\nIts transportation function focuses on shipping large quantities of high-density unassembled modules at low cost to the large stores.\\nThe strategy at every stage and function of the IKEA supply chain is aligned to grow the supply chain surplus.\\nIntraoperation Scope: The Minimize Local Cost View The intraoperation scope has each stage of the supply chain devising strategy independently.\\nIn such a setting, the resulting collection of strategies typically does not align, resulting in conflict.\\nThis limited scope was the dominant practice during the 1950s and 1960s, when each operation within each stage of the supply chain attempted to minimize its own costs.\\nAs a result of this narrow scope, the transportation function at many firms may have shipped full truckloads without any regard for the resulting impact on inventories or responsiveness.\\nHistorically, it was this localized scope that led sales functions in many consumer goods firms to offer trade promotions to enhance revenue without any consideration for how those promotions impacted production, warehousing, and transportation costs.\\nThe resulting lack of alignment diminished the supply chain surplus.\\nIntrafunctional Scope: The Minimize Functional Cost View Over time, managers recognized the weakness of the intraoperation scope and attempted to align all operations within a function.\\nFor example, the use of airfreight could be justified only if the resulting savings in inventories and improved responsiveness justified the increased transportation cost.\\nWith the intrafunctional view, firms attempted to align all operations within a function.\\nAll supply chain functions including sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation had to align their strategy to minimize total functional cost.\\nAs a result, product could be sourced from a higher cost local supplier because the resulting decrease in inventory and transportation costs more than compensated for the higher unit cost.\\nInterfunctional Scope: The Maximize Company Profit View The key weakness of the intrafunctional view is that different functions within a firm may have conflicting objectives.\\nOver time, companies became aware of this weakness as they saw, for example, marketing and sales focusing on revenue generation, and manufacturing and distribution focusing on cost reduction.\\nActions the two functions took were often in conflict, hurting the firm\\'s overall performance.\\nCompanies realized the importance of expanding the scope of  .\\nstrategic fit and aligning strategy across all functions within the firm.\\nWith the interfunctional scope, the goal is to maximize company profit.\\nTo achieve this goal, all functional strategies are developed to align with one another and the competitive strategy.\\nThe goal of aligning strategies across functions results in warehouse operations within McMaster-Carr carrying high inventory and excess capacity to ensure that marketing\\'s promise of next-day delivery is always met.\\nThe company\\'s profits grow because the increased margin that customers are willing to pay for high reliability more than compensates for the higher inventory and warehouse expense.\\nThe company enjoys high profits because all functions align their strategy around the common objective of customer convenience in the form of next-day delivery of a wide variety of MRO products.\\nIntercompany Scope: The Maximize Supply Chain Surplus View The goal of only maximizing company profits can sometimes lead to conflict between stages of a supply chain.\\nFor example, both the supplier and the manufacturer in a supply chain may prefer to have the other side hold most of the inventory with the goal of improving their own profits.\\nIf the two parties cannot look beyond their own profits, the more powerful party will simply force the other stage to hold inventories without any regard for where inventories are best held.\\nThe result is a decrease in the supply chain surplus--the total pie that both parties get to share.\\nThe intercompany scope proposes a different approach.\\nInstead of just forcing the inventory onto the weaker party, the two parties work together to reduce the amount of inventory required.\\nBy working together and sharing information, they can reduce inventories and total cost, thus growing the supply chain surplus.\\nThe higher the supply chain surplus, the more competitive the supply chain is.\\nKey Point The intercompany scope of strategic fit is essential today because the competitive playing field has shifted from company versus company to supply chain versus supply chain.\\nA company\\'s partners in the supply chain may well determine the company\\'s success, as the company is intimately tied to its supply chain.\\nA good example of the intercompany approach is how Wal-Mart and P&G plan promotions jointly.\\nThe two companies have a team (with employees from both parties) that works to ensure that the promotion is timed and executed to benefit both sides.\\nPrior to this collaborative effort, promotions at Wal-Mart sometimes required P&G to run its facilities with overtime at high cost.\\nThe result was a decrease in the supply chain surplus because the product was sold at a discount at a time when it was being produced at high marginal cost.\\nThe collaborative teams now try to grow the supply chain surplus by timing the promotion to have high sales impact while minimizing the marginal cost increase.\\nThey work to ensure that the product is produced in such a manner that all promotion demand is met without generating excess unsold inventories.\\nAgile Intercompany Scope Up to this point, we have discussed strategic fit in a static context; that is, the players in a supply chain and the customer needs do not change over time.\\nIn reality, the situation is much more dynamic.\\nProduct life cycles are getting shorter, and companies must satisfy the changing needs of individual customers.\\nA company may have to partner with many firms, depending on the product being produced and the customer being served.\\nThe strategy and operations at firms must be agile enough to maintain strategic fit in a changing environment.\\nAgile intercompany scope refers to a firm\\'s ability to achieve strategic fit when partnering with supply chain stages that change over time.\\nFirms must think in terms of supply chains  .\\nKey Point The intercompany scope of strategic fit requires firms to evaluate every action in the context of the entire supply chain.\\nThis broad scope increases the size of the surplus to be shared among all stages of the supply chain.\\nconsisting of many players at each stage.\\nFor example, a manufacturer may interface with a different set of suppliers and distributors depending on the product being produced and the customer being served.\\nFurthermore, as customer needs vary over time, firms must have the ability to become part of new supply chains while ensuring strategic fit.\\nThis level of agility becomes more important as the competitive environment becomes more dynamic.\\nThe key to achieving strategic fit is a company\\'s ability to find a balance between responsiveness and efficiency that best matches the needs of its target customer.\\nIn deciding where this balance should be located on the responsiveness spectrum, companies face many challenges.\\nOn one hand, these challenges have made it much more difficult for companies to create the ideal balance.\\nOn the other hand, they have afforded companies increased opportunities for improving supply chain management.\\nManagers need a solid understanding of the impact of these challenges because they are critical to a company\\'s ability to grow its supply chain surplus.\\nIncreasing Product Variety and Shrinking Life Cycles One of the biggest challenges to maintaining strategic fit is the growth in product variety and the decrease in the life cycle of many products.\\nGreater product variety and shorter life cycles increase uncertainty while reducing the window of opportunity within which the supply chain can achieve fit.\\nThe challenge gets magnified when companies continue to increase new products without maintaining the discipline of eliminating older ones.\\nApple has had great success limiting its product variety while continuing to introduce new products.\\nThis has allowed the company the luxury of dealing only with high-demand products for which it becomes easier to design an aligned supply chain.\\nIn general, however, firms must design product platforms with common components and maintain a tailored supply chain that contains a responsive solution to handle new products and other low-volume products and a low-cost solution to handle successful high-volume products.\\nSimultaneously, variety must be limited to what truly adds value to the customer.\\nThis often requires the continuous elimination of older products.\\nGlobalization and Increasing Uncertainty Globalization has increased both the opportunities and risks for supply chains.\\nThe 21st century has started with significant fluctuations in exchange rates, global demand, and the price of crude oil, all factors that impact supply chain performance.\\nIn 2008 alone, the euro peaked in value at about $1.59 and went as low as $1.25.\\nIn 2001, the euro went as low as $0.85.\\nAfter demand for automobiles in the United States peaked at more than 17 million vehicles, demand dropped significantly between November 2007 and October 2008.\\nIn October 2008, auto sales in the United States dropped by more than 30 percent relative to the same month the previous year.\\nThe drop in sales of larger vehicles was much more significant than the drop for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.\\nCrude oil peaked at more than $145 a barrel in July 2008 and was less than $50 a barrel by November 2008.\\nSupply chains designed to handle these uncertainties have performed much better than those that ignored them.\\nFor example, Honda built flexible plants that were a great help in 2008 as demand for SUVs dropped but demand for small cars increased.\\nHonda\\'s flexible plants that  .\\nproduced both the CRV and small cars on the same line continued strong operations.\\nIn contrast, companies that had built plants dedicated to producing only large trucks and SUVs had a lot of difficulty in 2008 as demand dried up.\\nClearly, firms must account for global risks and uncertainties if they want to maintain strategic fit.\\nFragmentation of Supply Chain Ownership Over the past several decades, most firms have become less vertically integrated.\\nAs companies have shed noncore functions, they have been able to take advantage of supplier and customer competencies that they themselves did not have.\\nThis new ownership structure, however, has also made aligning and managing the supply chain more difficult.\\nWith the chain broken into many owners, each with its own policies and interests, the chain is more difficult to coordinate.\\nThis problem could potentially cause each stage of a supply chain to work only toward its own objectives rather than the whole chain\\'s, resulting in the reduction of overall supply chain profitability.\\nAligning all members of a supply chain has become critical to achieving supply chain fit.\\nChanging Technology and Business Environment As customer needs and technology change, firms are forced to constantly rethink their supply chain strategy.\\nA strategy that may have been very successful in one environment can easily become a weakness in a changed setting.\\nDell is an excellent example of this difficulty.\\nFor more than a decade, Dell enjoyed tremendous success with a supply chain strategy based on selling customized PCs direct to customers.\\nThese PCs were built to order in flexible facilities.\\nBy about 2005, the market had moved toward laptops, and customers started to place less value on customization.\\nAs a result, Dell was forced to rethink its supply chain strategy and start selling through retail outlets.\\nSimultaneously, it started to increase the amount of assembly that was outsourced to low-cost contract manufacturers.\\nAnother example is that of Blockbuster, which achieved tremendous success in the 1990s with stores that carried more variety of VHS tapes than existing video rental stores.\\nWith the growth of DVDs, Netflix used the postal system to ship an even greater variety of films at low cost from centralized distribution centers.\\nThe growth in bandwidth allowed Netflix to stream digital content directly to customer homes.\\nSimultaneously, Redbox developed vending machines that allowed some DVDs to be rented at low cost.\\nBlockbuster\\'s inability to adjust to this transformation in technology and the business environment resulted in its bankruptcy in 2010.\\nWith a changing environment, companies must constantly evaluate their supply chain strategy to maintain strategic fit.\\nThe Environment and Sustainability Issues related to the environment and sustainability have grown in relevance and must be accounted for when designing supply chain strategy.\\nIn some instances, regulation has been driving changes; in others, change has been driven by the perception of the lack of sustainability as a risk factor.\\nFor example, the WEEE (Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment)/RoHS (Restricted Hazardous Substances) directives from the European Union forced cell phone manufacturers to rethink their design and sourcing strategies.\\nStarbucks, in contrast, was forced to focus on local sustainability of its supply sources because a supply failure, especially for higher quality coffee, would have significantly impacted its ability to grow.\\nThe company developed sourcing guidelines to ensure that produced coffee met environmental and social performance criteria at each stage of the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental issues represent a tremendous opportunity to firms that can often add value to customers and lower their own costs along this dimension (for example, with more appropriate packaging).\\nThese issues also represent a major challenge because some of the greatest opportunities require coordination across different members of the supply chain.\\nTo be successful, firms will need to design a strategy that engages the entire supply chain to identify and address opportunities for improved sustainability.\\nKey Point Many challenges, such as rising product variety and shorter life cycles, have made it increasingly difficult for supply chains to achieve strategic fit.\\nOvercoming these challenges offers a tremendous opportunity for firms to use supply chain management to gain competitive advantage.\\nExplain why achieving strategic fit is critical to a company\\'s overall success.\\nA lack of strategic fit between the competitive and supply chain strategies can result in the supply chain taking actions that are not consistent with customer needs, leading to a reduction in supply chain surplus and decreasing supply chain profitability.\\nStrategic fit requires that all functions within a firm and stages in the supply chain target the same goal, one that is consistent with customer needs.\\nDescribe how a company achieves strategic fit between its supply chain strategy and its competitive strategy.\\nTo achieve strategic fit, a company must first understand the needs of the customers being served, understand the uncertainty of the supply chain, and identify the implied uncertainty.\\nThe second step is to understand the supply chain\\'s capabilities in terms of efficiency and responsiveness.\\nThe key to strategic fit is ensuring that supply chain responsiveness is consistent with customer needs, supply capabilities, and the resulting implied uncertainty.\\nTailoring the supply chain is essential to achieving strategic fit when supplying a wide variety of customers with many products through different channels.\\nDiscuss the importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit across the supply chain.\\nThe scope of strategic fit refers to the functions and stages within a supply chain that coordinate strategy and target a common goal.\\nWhen the scope is narrow, individual functions try to optimize their performance based on their own goals.\\nThis practice often results in conflicting actions that reduce the supply chain surplus.\\nAs the scope of strategic fit is enlarged to include the entire supply chain, actions are evaluated based on their impact on overall supply chain performance, which helps increase supply chain surplus.\\nDescribe the major challenges that must be overcome to manage a supply chain successfully.\\nGlobalization, increasing product variety, decreasing product life cycles, fragmentation of supply chains, changing technologies, and an increased focus on sustainability represent significant challenges to achieving strategic fit.\\nThey also represent great opportunities for firms that can successfully address these challenges with their supply chain strategy.\\n Describe key financial measures of firm performance.\\nIdentify the major drivers of supply chain performance.\\nDiscuss the role of each driver in creating strategic fit between the supply chain strategy and the competitive strategy.\\nDefine the key metrics that track the performance of the supply chain in terms of each driver.\\nIn this chapter, our goal is to link key financial measures of firm performance to supply chain performance.\\nWe introduce the three logistical drivers--facilities, inventory, and transportation--and the three cross-functional drivers--information, sourcing, and pricing--that determine the performance of any supply chain.\\nWe discuss how these drivers are used in the design, planning, and operation of the supply chain.\\nWe define several metrics that can be used to gauge the performance of each driver and its impact on financial performance.\\nIn Chapter 1,we discussed how growing the supply chain surplus is the ultimate goal of a supply chain.\\nOur premise was that growing the surplus allows for a growth of supply chain profitability, which facilitates an improvement in the financial performance of each member of the supply chain.\\nIn this section, we define important financial measures that are reported by a firm and impacted by supply chain performance.\\nIn later sections, we then link supply chain drivers and associated metrics to the various financial measures.\\nThe definitions of financial measures in this section are taken from Dyckman, Magee, and Pfeiffer (2011).\\nFrom a shareholder perspective, return on equity (ROE) is the main summary measure of a firm\\'s performance.\\nROE =  Net Income  Average Shareholder Equity  38  .\\nWhereas ROE measures the return on investment made by a firm\\'s shareholders, return on assets (ROA) measures the return earned on each dollar invested by the firm in assets.\\nEarnings before interest Net income + [Interest expense * (1 - Tax rate)]  ROA =  =  Average total assets  Average total assets  Consider Amazon.com\\'s financial performance shown in Table 3-1.\\nIn 2009, Amazon achieved ROE  9025,257  17.2 percent {1,1526,864  16.8 percent in 2010} and ROA  [90234*(1.35)]13,813  6.7 percent {[1,152  39*(1 ?.35)]18,797  6.3 percent in 2010}.\\nThe difference between ROE and ROA is referred to as return on financial leverage (ROFL).\\nIn 2009, Amazon had ROFL  17.2  6.7  10.5 percent {16.86.3  10.5 percent in 2010}.\\nROFL captures the amount of ROE that can be attributed to financial leverage (accounts payable, debt, etc.).\\nIn Amazon\\'s case, a significant portion of the financial leverage in 2009 and 2010 came from accounts payable rather than debt.\\nThus, an important ratio that defines financial leverage is accounts payable turnover (APT).\\nCost of goods sold APT = Accounts payable  Table 3-1 Selected Financial Data for

inventory turnover (INVT); and property, plant and equipment turnover (PPET).\\nThese are defined as follows:  ART =  Sales revenue  ; INVT =  Cost of goods sold ; PPET  =  Sales revenue  Accounts receivable  Inventories  PP&E  Amazon achieved accounts receivable turnover of 24,5091,260  19.45 {34,2041,783  19.18 in 2010} in 2009.\\nAmazon collected its money from sales relatively quickly (in about 5219.45  2.7 weeks on average in 2009) after it made a sale.\\nAmazon turned its inventory about 18,978/2,171  8.74 {26,561/3,202  8.30 in 2010} times and had PPET  24,5091,290  19.00 {34,204/2,414  14.17 in 2010} in 2009.\\nThus, inventory sat with Amazon in 2009 for about 52/8.74  5.95 {52/8.30  6.27 in 2010} weeks on average, and each dollar invested in property, plant and equipment supported about $19 {$14.17 in 2010} of sales in 2009.\\nObserve that Amazon saw its inventory turns and PPET decrease in 2010 relative to 2009.\\nAmazon can improve its asset turnover by turning its inventory more quickly or using its existing warehousing and technology infrastructure to support a higher level of sales (or decreasing the warehousing and technology infrastructure needed to support the existing level of sales).\\nAnother useful metric is the cash-to-cash (C2C) cycle, which roughly measures the average amount of time from when cash enters the process as cost to when it returns as collected revenue.\\nC2C = - weeks payable (1/APT) + weeks in inventory (1/INVT) + weeks receivable (1/ART)  In Amazon\\'s case, we obtain C2C  ?0.18  5.95  2.70  ?1.53 {?0.31  6.27  2.71  ?1.33 in 2010} in 2009.\\nIn 2009 and 2010, Amazon was collecting its money from the sale of products more than 11 weeks before it had to pay its suppliers.\\nAs we discussed earlier, this allowed Amazon to achieve significant financial leverage without having to take on debt.\\nThere are two important measures, however, that are not explicitly part of a firm\\'s financial statements.\\nThey are markdowns and lost sales.\\nMarkdowns represent the discounts required to convince customers to buy excess inventory.\\nFinancial statements show only the revenue received from sales, not the revenue that \"could\" have been received.\\nFor General Motors (GM), one of the biggest problems in the early part of the 21st century was the discounts required to move excess inventory from dealer lots.\\nThese discounts significantly hurt financial performance.\\nof the biggest improvements in financial performance for GM was its ability to sell its cars with much smaller discounts because the supply chain had far less excess inventory.\\nLost sales represent customer sales that did not materialize because of the absence of products the customer wanted to buy.\\nEvery lost sale corresponds to product margin that is lost.\\nBoth markdowns and lost sales reduce net income and arguably represent the biggest impact of supply chain performance on the financial performance of a firm.\\nFirms like Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Zara that achieve strong financial performance do so in large part because their supply chains allow them to better match supply and demand, thereby reducing markdowns and lost sales.\\nFrom our brief discussion of Amazon\\'s financial statements, supply chain management activities such as planning, transportation, inventory, and warehousing clearly have a significant impact on financial performance.\\nIn the next section, we identify key drivers of supply chain performance that influence the financial performance of a firm.\\nFirst we define each driver and discuss its impact on the performance of the supply chain.\\nFacilities are the actual physical locations in the supply chain network where product is stored, assembled, or fabricated.\\nThe two major types of facilities are production sites and storage sites.\\nDecisions regarding the role, location, capacity, and flexibility of facilities have a significant impact on the supply chain\\'s performance.\\nFor example, in 2009, Amazon increased the number of warehousing facilities (observe increase in Property, plant and equipment, in Table 3-1) located close to customers to improve its responsiveness.\\nIn contrast, Blockbuster tried to improve its efficiency in 2010 by shutting down many facilities even though it reduced responsiveness.\\nFacility costs show up under property, plant and equipment, if facilities are owned by the firm or under selling, general, and administrative if they are leased.\\nInventory encompasses all raw materials, work in process, and finished goods within a supply chain.\\nThe inventory belonging to a firm is reported under assets.\\nChanging inventory policies can dramatically alter the supply chain\\'s efficiency and responsiveness.\\nFor example, W.W. Grainger makes itself responsive by stocking large amounts of inventory and satisfying customer demand from stock even though the high inventory levels reduce efficiency.\\nSuch a practice makes sense for Grainger because its products hold their value for a long time.\\nA strategy using high inventory levels can be dangerous in the fashion apparel business where inventory loses value relatively quickly with changing seasons and trends.\\nRather than hold high levels of inventory, Spanish apparel retailer Zara has worked hard to shorten new product and replenishment lead times.\\nAs a result, the company is very responsive but carries low levels of inventory.\\nZara thus provides responsiveness at low cost.\\nTransportation entails moving inventory from point to point in the supply chain.\\nTransportation can take the form of many combinations of modes and routes, each with its own performance characteristics.\\nTransportation choices have a large impact on supply chain responsiveness and efficiency.\\nFor example, a mail-order catalog company can use a faster mode of transportation such as FedEx to ship products, thus making its supply chain more responsive, but also less efficient given the high costs associated with using FedEx.\\nW.W. Grainger, however, have structured their supply chain to provide next-day service to most of their customers using ground transportation.\\nThey are providing a high level of responsiveness at lower cost.\\nOutbound transportation costs of shipping to the customer are typically included in selling, general, and administrative expense, while inbound transportation costs are typically included in the cost of goods sold.\\nInformation consists of data and analysis concerning facilities, inventory, transportation, costs, prices, and customers throughout the supply chain.\\nInformation is potentially the biggest driver of performance in the supply chain because it directly affects each of the other drivers.\\nInformation presents management with the opportunity to make supply chains more responsive and more efficient.\\nFor example, Seven-Eleven Japan has used information to better match supply and demand while achieving production and distribution economies.\\nThe result is a high level of responsiveness to customer demand while production and replenishment costs are lowered.\\nInformation technology訃elated expenses are typically included under either operating expense (typically under selling, general, and administrative expense) or assets.\\nFor example, in 2009, Amazon included $1.24 billion in technology expense under operating expense and another $551 million under fixed assets to be depreciated.\\nSourcing is the choice of who will perform a particular supply chain activity such as production, storage, transportation, or the management of information.\\nAt the strategic level, these decisions determine what functions a firm performs and what functions the firm outsources.\\nSourcing decisions affect both the responsiveness and efficiency of a supply chain.\\nAfter Motorola outsourced much of its production to contract manufacturers in China, it saw its efficiency improve but its responsiveness suffer because of the long distances.\\nTo make up for the drop in responsiveness, Motorola started flying in some of its cell phones from China even though this choice increased transportation cost.\\nFlextronics, an electronics contract manufacturer, is hoping to offer both responsive and efficient sourcing options to its customers.\\nIt is trying to make its production facilities in high-cost locations very responsive while keeping its facilities in low-cost countries efficient.\\nFlextronics hopes to become an effective source for all customers using this combination of facilities.\\nSourcing costs show up in the cost of goods sold, and monies owed to suppliers are recorded under accounts payable.\\nPricing determines how much a firm will charge for the goods and services that it makes available in the supply chain.\\nPricing affects the behavior of the buyer of the good or service, thus affecting supply chain performance.\\nFor example, if a transportation company varies its charges based on the lead time provided by the customers, it is likely that customers who value efficiency will order early and customers who value responsiveness will be willing to wait and order just before they need a product transported.\\nDifferential pricing provides responsiveness to customers that value it and low cost to customers that do not value responsiveness as much.\\nAny change in pricing impacts revenues directly but could also affect costs based on the impact of this change on the other drivers.\\nOur definitions of these drivers attempt to delineate logistics and supply chain management.\\nSupply chain management includes the use of logistical and cross-functional drivers to increase the supply chain surplus.\\nCross-functional drivers have become increasingly important in raising the supply chain surplus in recent years.\\nWhile logistics remains a major part, supply chain management is increasingly becoming focused on the three cross-functional drivers.\\nIt is important to realize that these drivers do not act independently but interact to determine the overall supply chain performance.\\nGood supply chain design and operation recognize this interaction and make the appropriate trade-offs to deliver the desired level of responsiveness.\\nConsider, for example, the furniture industry in the United States.\\nLow-cost furniture sourced from Asia is available at many discount retailers.\\nThe primary goal of this supply chain is to deliver a low price and acceptable quality.\\nVariety is typically low and retailers such as Wal-Mart stock inventory of finished goods.\\nThe low variety and stable replenishment orders allow furniture manufacturers in Asia to focus on efficiency.\\nGiven the available inventory, low-cost modes  .\\nof transportation from Asia are used.\\nIn this instance, relatively low-cost inventory at the retailer allows the supply chain to become efficient by lowering transportation and production costs.\\nIn contrast, some U.S. furniture makers have chosen to focus on providing variety.\\nGiven the high variety and high prices, keeping inventory of all variants at a retailer would be very expensive.\\nIn this case, the supply chain has been designed so that the retailer carries little inventory.\\nCustomers place their orders with the retailer by seeing one variant of the furniture and selecting among the various options.\\nThe supply chain is made responsive by using information technology to convey order information effectively, structuring flexible manufacturing facilities to be able to produce in small lots, and using responsive transportation to deliver the furniture to the customer.\\nIn this instance, responsive facilities, transportation, and information are used to lower inventory costs.\\nAs the rest of this chapter will illustrate, the key to achieving strategic fit and strong financial performance across the supply chain is to structure the supply chain drivers appropriately to provide the desired level of responsiveness at the lowest possible cost.\\n(2010) point out that supply chain performance affects nearly 35 percent of the financial performance of apparel retailers.\\nAs a percentage of sales, they state that markdowns, representing 10?0 percent of sales, and lost sales, representing 5?0 percent of sales, are the dominant drivers of retailers\\' financial performance.\\nThey further state that transportation represents 2?\\npercent, warehousing 1?\\npercent, store product handling 3?\\npercent, and inventory costs 2?\\nWhile the precise fraction will vary for different supply chains, it is evident that supply chain performance along the six drivers has a significant influence on a firm\\'s financial performance.\\nBefore we discuss each of the six drivers in detail, we put these drivers into a framework that helps clarify the role of each in improving supply chain performance.\\nRecall from Chapter 2 that the goal of a supply chain strategy is to strike the balance between responsiveness and efficiency that fits with the competitive strategy.\\nTo reach this goal, a company must structure the right combination of the three logistical and three cross-functional drivers.\\nThe combined impact of these drivers then determines the responsiveness and the profits of the entire supply chain.\\nWe provide a visual framework for supply chain decision making in Figure 3-1.\\nMost companies begin with a competitive strategy and then decide what their supply chain strategy ought to be.\\nThe supply chain strategy determines how the supply chain should perform with respect to efficiency and responsiveness.\\nThe supply chain must then use the three logistical and three cross-functional drivers to reach the performance level the supply chain strategy dictates and maximize the supply chain profits.\\nAlthough this framework is generally viewed from the top down, in many instances, a study of the six drivers may indicate the need to change the supply chain strategy and potentially even the competitive strategy.\\nConsider this framework using Wal-Mart as an example.\\nWal-Mart\\'s competitive strategy is to be a reliable, low-cost retailer for a wide variety of mass-consumption goods.\\nThis strategy dictates that the ideal supply chain will emphasize efficiency but also maintain an adequate level of responsiveness in terms of product availability.\\nWal-Mart uses the three logistical and three crossfunctional drivers effectively to achieve this type of supply chain performance.\\nWith the inventory driver, Wal-Mart maintains an efficient supply chain by keeping low levels of inventory.\\nFor instance, Wal-Mart pioneered cross-docking, a system in which inventory is not stocked in a warehouse but rather is shipped to stores from the manufacturer with a brief stop at a distribution center (DCs), where product is transferred from inbound trucks from the supplier to outbound trucks to the retail store.\\nThis significantly lowers inventory because products are stocked only at stores, not at both stores and warehouses.\\nWith respect to inventory, Wal-Mart favors efficiency over responsiveness.\\nOn the transportation front, Wal-Mart runs its own fleet, to keep responsiveness high.\\nThis increases transportation cost, but the benefits in terms of reduced inventory and improved product  .\\nCompetitive Strategy  Efficiency  Supply Chain Strategy Supply Chain Structure  Responsiveness  Logistical Drivers  Facilities  Inventory  Transportation  Information  Sourcing  Pricing  Cross-Functional Drivers .\\navailability justify this cost in Wal-Mart\\'s case.\\nIn the case of facilities, Wal-Mart uses centrally located DCs within its network of stores to decrease the number of facilities and increase efficiency at each DC.\\nWal-Mart builds retail stores only where the demand is sufficient to justify having several of them supported by a DC, thereby increasing efficiency of its transportation assets.\\nWal-Mart has invested significantly more than its competitors in information technology, allowing the company to feed demand information across the supply chain to suppliers who manufacture only what is being demanded.\\nAs a result, Wal-Mart is a leader in its use of the information driver to improve responsiveness and decrease inventory investment.\\nWith regard to the sourcing driver, Wal-Mart identifies efficient sources for each product it sells.\\nWal-Mart feeds them large orders, allowing them to be efficient by exploiting economies of scale.\\nFinally, for the pricing driver, Wal-Mart practices \"every day low pricing\" (EDLP) for its products.\\nThis ensures that customer demand stays steady and does not fluctuate with price variations.\\nThe entire supply chain then focuses on meeting this demand in an efficient manner.\\nWal-Mart uses all the supply chain drivers to achieve the right balance between responsiveness and efficiency so that its competitive strategy and supply chain strategy are in harmony.\\nWe devote the next six sections to a detailed discussion of each of the three logistical and three cross-functional drivers, their roles in the supply chain, and their impact on financial performance.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that facilities play in the supply chain and critical facility-related decisions that supply chain managers need to make.\\nRole in the Supply Chain If we think of inventory as what is being passed along the supply chain and transportation as how it is passed along, then facilities are the where of the supply chain.\\nThey are the locations to or from which the inventory is transported.\\nWithin a facility, inventory is either transformed into another state (manufacturing) or it is stored (warehousing).\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy Facilities are a key driver of supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency.\\nFor example, companies can gain economies of scale when a product is manufactured or stored in only one location; this centralization increases efficiency.\\nThe cost reduction, however, comes at the expense of responsiveness, as many of a company\\'s customers may be located far from the production facility.\\nThe opposite is also true.\\nLocating facilities close to customers increases the number of facilities needed and consequently reduces efficiency.\\nIf the customer demands and is willing to pay for the responsiveness that having numerous facilities adds, however, then this facilities decision helps meet the company\\'s competitive strategy goals.\\nEXAMPLE 3-1 Toyota and Honda Both Toyota and Honda use facilities decisions to be more responsive to their customers.\\nThese companies have an end goal of opening manufacturing facilities in every major market that they enter.\\nWhile there are other benefits to opening local facilities, such as protection from currency fluctuation and trade barriers, the increase in responsiveness plays a large role in Toyota\\'s and Honda\\'s decision to place facilities in their local markets.\\nThe flexibility of Honda facilities to assemble both SUVs and cars in the same plant allowed the company to keep costs down in the downturn of 2008.\\nWhile competitors\\' SUV production facilities were idle, Honda facilities maintained a high level of utilization.\\nComponents of Facilities Decisions Decisions regarding facilities are a crucial part of supply chain design.\\nWe now identify components of facilities decisions that companies must analyze.\\nROLE Firms must decide whether production facilities will be flexible, dedicated, or a combination of the two.\\nFlexible capacity can be used for many types of products but is often less efficient, whereas dedicated capacity can be used for only a limited number of products but is more efficient.\\nFirms must also decide whether to design a facility with a product focus or a functional focus.\\nA product-focused facility performs all functions (e.g., fabrication and assembly) needed for producing a single type of product.\\nA functional-focused facility performs a given set of functions (e.g., fabrication or assembly) on many types of products.\\nA product focus tends to result in more expertise about a particular type of product at the expense of the functional expertise that comes from a functional methodology.\\nFor warehouses and DCs, firms must decide whether they will be primarily cross-docking facilities or storage facilities.\\nAt cross-docking facilities, inbound trucks from suppliers are unloaded; the product is broken into smaller lots and is quickly loaded onto store-bound trucks.\\nEach store-bound truck carries a variety of products, some from each inbound truck.\\nFor storage facilities, firms must decide on the products to be stored at each facility.\\nLOCATION Deciding where a company will locate its facilities constitutes a large part of the design of a supply chain.\\nA basic trade-off here is whether to centralize in order to gain economies of scale or to decentralize to become more responsive by being closer to the customer.\\nCompanies must also consider a host of issues related to the various characteristics of the local area in which the facility is situated.\\nThese include macroeconomic factors, quality of workers, cost of workers, cost of facility, availability of infrastructure, proximity to customers, the location of that firm\\'s other facilities, tax effects, and other strategic factors.\\nCAPACITY Companies must also determine a facility\\'s capacity to perform its intended function or functions.\\nA large amount of excess capacity allows the facility to respond to wide swings in the demands placed on it.\\nExcess capacity, however, costs money and therefore can decrease efficiency.\\nA facility with little excess capacity will likely be more efficient per unit of product it produces than one with a lot of unused capacity.\\nThe high-utilization facility, however, will have difficulty responding to demand fluctuations.\\nTherefore, a company must make a trade-off to determine the right amount of capacity to have at each of its facilities.\\nFACILITY-RELATED METRICS Facility-related decisions impact both the financial performance of the firm and the supply chain\\'s responsiveness to customers.\\nOn the financial side, facilities decisions impact the cost of goods sold and the assets in property plant and equipment.\\nA manager should track the following facility-related metrics that influence supply chain performance: ?Capacity measures the maximum amount a facility can process.\\n?Utilization measures the fraction of capacity that is currently being used in the facility.\\nUtilization affects both the unit cost of processing and the associated delays.\\nUnit costs tend to decline (PPET increases) and delays increase with increasing utilization.\\n?Processing/setup/down/idle time measure the fraction of time that the facility was processing units, being set up to process units, unavailable because it was down, or idle because it had no units to process.\\nIdeally, utilization should be limited by demand and not setup or downtime.\\n?Production cost per unit measures the average cost to produce a unit of output.\\nThese costs may be measured per unit, per case, or per pound depending on the product.\\n?Quality losses measure the fraction of production lost due to defects.\\nQuality losses hurt both financial performance and responsiveness.\\n?Theoretical flow/cycle time of production measures the time required to process a unit if there are absolutely no delays at any stage.\\n?Actual average flow/cycle time measures the average actual time taken for all units processed over a specified duration such as a week or month.\\nThe actual flow/cycle time includes the theoretical time and any delays.\\nThis metric should be used when setting due dates for orders.\\n?Flow time efficiency is the ratio of the theoretical flow time to the actual average flow time.\\nLow values for flow time efficiency indicate that a large fraction of time is spent waiting.\\n?Product variety measures the number of products/product families processed in a facility.\\nProcessing costs and flow times are likely to increase with product variety.\\n?Volume contribution of top 20 percent SKUs and customers measures the fraction of total volume processed by a facility that comes from the top 20 percent SKUs or customers.\\nAn 80/20 outcome in which the top 20 percent contribute 80 percent of volume indicates likely benefits from focusing the facility where separate processes are used to process the top 20 percent and the remaining 80 percent.\\n?Average production batch size measures the average amount produced in each production batch.\\nLarge batch sizes will decrease production cost but increase inventories.\\n?Production service level measures the fraction of production orders completed on time and in full.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: RESPONSIVENESS VERSUS EFFICIENCY The fundamental trade-off that managers face when making facilities decisions is between the cost of the number, location, capacity, and type of facilities (efficiency) and the level of responsiveness that these facilities  .\\nprovide the company\\'s customers.\\nIncreasing the number of facilities increases facility and inventory costs but decreases transportation costs and reduces response time.\\nIncreasing the flexibility or capacity of a facility increases facility costs but decreases inventory costs and response time.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that inventory plays in the supply chain and how managers use inventory to drive supply chain performance.\\nRole in the Supply Chain Inventory exists in the supply chain because of a mismatch between supply and demand.\\nThis mismatch is intentional at a steel manufacturer, where it is economical to manufacture in large lots that are then stored for future sales.\\nThe mismatch is also intentional at a retail store where inventory is held in anticipation of future demand.\\nAn important role that inventory plays in the supply chain is to increase the amount of demand that can be satisfied by having the product ready and available when the customer wants it.\\nAnother significant role that inventory plays is to reduce cost by exploiting economies of scale that may exist during production and distribution.\\nInventory impacts the assets held, the costs incurred, and responsiveness provided in the supply chain.\\nHigh levels of inventory in an apparel supply chain improve responsiveness but also leave the supply chain vulnerable to the need for markdowns, lowering profit margins.\\nLow levels of inventory improve inventory turns but may result in lost sales if customers are unable to find products they are ready to buy.\\nInventory also has a significant impact on the material flow time in a supply chain.\\nMaterial flow time is the time that elapses between the point at which material enters the supply chain to the point at which it exits.\\nFor a supply chain, throughput is the rate at which sales occur.\\nIf inventory is represented by I, flow time by T, and throughput by D, the three can be related using Little\\'s law as follows:  I = DT  .\\nFor example, if the flow time of an auto assembly process is 10 hours and the throughput is 60 units an hour, Little\\'s law tells us that the inventory is 60  10  600 units.\\nIf we were able to reduce inventory to 300 units while holding throughput constant, we would reduce our flow time to 5 hours (300/60).\\nWe note that in this relationship, inventory and throughput must have consistent units.\\nThe logical conclusion here is that inventory and flow time are synonymous in a supply chain because throughput is often determined by customer demand.\\nManagers should use actions that lower the amount of inventory needed without increasing cost or reducing responsiveness, because reduced flow time can be a significant advantage in a supply chain.\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy The form, location, and quantity of inventory allow a supply chain to range from being very low cost to very responsive.\\nLarge amounts of finished goods inventory close to customers allow a supply chain to be responsive but at a high cost.\\nCentralized inventory in raw material form allows a supply chain to lower cost but at the expense of responsiveness.\\nThe goal of good supply chain design is to find the right form, location, and quantity of inventory that provides the right level of responsiveness at the lowest possible cost.\\nEXAMPLE 3-2 Amazon.com Amazon attempts to provide a wide variety of books (among other products) to its customers.\\nBest-selling books are stocked in many regional warehouses close to customers for high responsiveness.\\nSlower moving books are stocked at fewer warehouses to lower the cost of inventory at the expense of some responsiveness.\\nSome of the slowest moving books are not held in inventory but are obtained from the publisher/distributor or printed on demand when requested by a customer.\\nAmazon changes the form, location, and quantity of inventory it holds by the level of sales of a book to provide the right balance of responsiveness and efficiency.\\nComponents of Inventory Decisions We now identify major inventory-related decisions that supply chain managers must make to effectively create more responsive and more efficient supply chains.\\nCYCLE INVENTORY Cycle inventory is the average amount of inventory used to satisfy demand between receipts of supplier shipments.\\nThe size of the cycle inventory is a result of the production, transportation, or purchase of material in large lots.\\nCompanies produce or purchase in large lots to exploit economies of scale in the production, transportation, or purchasing process.\\nWith the increase in lot size, however, comes an increase in carrying costs.\\nAs an example of a cycle stock decision, consider an online book retailer.\\nThis retailer\\'s sales average around 10 truckloads of books a month.\\nThe cycle inventory decisions the retailer must make are how much to order for replenishment and how often to place these orders.\\nThe e-retailer could order 10 truckloads once each month or it could order one truckload every three days.\\nThe basic trade-off supply chain managers face is the cost of holding larger lots of inventory (when cycle inventory is high) versus the cost of ordering product frequently (when cycle inventory is low).\\nSAFETY INVENTORY Safety inventory is inventory held in case demand exceeds expectation; it is held to counter uncertainty.\\nIf the world were perfectly predictable, only cycle inventory would be needed.\\nBecause demand is uncertain and may exceed expectations, however, companies hold safety inventory to satisfy an unexpectedly high demand.\\nManagers face a key decision when determining how much safety inventory to hold.\\nFor example, a toy retailer such as Toys \"R\" Us must calculate its safety inventory for the holiday buying season.\\nIf it has too much safety inventory, toys go unsold and may have to be discounted after the holidays.\\nIf the company has too little safety inventory, however, then Toys \"R\" Us loses sales, along with the margin those sales would have brought.\\nTherefore, choosing safety inventory involves making a trade-off between the costs of having too much inventory and the costs of losing sales due to not having enough inventory.\\nSEASONAL INVENTORY Seasonal inventory is built up to counter predictable seasonal variability in demand.\\nCompanies using seasonal inventory build up inventory in periods of low demand and store it for periods of high demand when they will not have the capacity to produce all that is demanded.\\nManagers face key decisions in determining whether to build seasonal inventory, and if they do build it, in deciding how much to build.\\nIf a company can rapidly change the rate of its production system at very low cost, then it may not need seasonal inventory, because the production system can adjust to a period of high demand without incurring large costs.\\nHowever, if changing the rate of production is expensive (e.g., when workers must be hired or fired), then a company would be wise to establish a smooth production rate and build up its inventory during periods of low demand.\\nTherefore, the basic trade-off supply chain managers face in determining how much seasonal inventory to build is the cost of carrying the additional seasonal inventory versus the cost of having a more flexible production rate.\\nLEVEL OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY Level of product availability is the fraction of demand that is served on time from product held in inventory.\\nA high level of product availability provides a high level of responsiveness but increases cost because much inventory is held but rarely used.\\nIn contrast, a low level of product availability lowers inventory holding cost but results in a higher fraction of customers who are not served on time.\\nThe basic trade-off when determining the level of product availability is between the cost of inventory to increase product availability and the loss from not serving customers on time.\\nINVENTORY-RELATED METRICS Inventory-related decisions affect the cost of goods sold, the cashto-cash cycle, and the assets held by the supply chain and its responsiveness to customers.\\nA manager should track the following inventory-related metrics that influence supply chain performance: ?Cash-to-cash cycle time is a high-level metric that includes inventories, accounts payable, and receivables.\\n?Average inventory measures the average amount of inventory carried.\\nAverage inventory should be measured in units, days of demand, and financial value.\\n?Inventory turns measure the number of times inventory turns over in a year.\\nIt is the ratio of average inventory to either the cost of goods sold or sales.\\n?Products with more than a specified number of days of inventory identifies the products for which the firm is carrying a high level of inventory.\\nThis metric can be used to identify products that are in oversupply or to identify reasons that justify the high inventory, such as price discounts or being a very slow mover.\\n?Average replenishment batch size measures the average amount in each replenishment order.\\nThe batch size should be measured by SKU in terms of both units and days of demand.\\nIt can be estimated by averaging over time the difference between the maximum and the minimum inventory (measured in each replenishment cycle) on hand.\\n?Average safety inventory measures the average amount of inventory on hand when a replenishment order arrives.\\nAverage safety inventory should be measured by SKU in both units and days of demand.\\nIt can be estimated by averaging over time the minimum inventory on hand in each replenishment cycle.\\n?Seasonal inventory measures the difference between the inflow of product (beyond cycle and safety inventory) and its sales that is purchased solely to deal with anticipated spikes in demand.\\n?Fill rate (order/case) measures the fraction of orders/demand that were met on time from inventory.\\nFill rate should not be averaged over time but over a specified number of units of demand (say, every thousand, million, etc.).\\n?Fraction of time out of stock measures the fraction of time that a particular SKU had zero inventory.\\nThis fraction can be used to estimate the lost sales during the stock out period.\\n?Obsolete inventory measures the fraction of inventory older than a specified obsolescence date.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: RESPONSIVENESS VERSUS EFFICIENCY The fundamental trade-off that managers face when making inventory decisions is between responsiveness and efficiency.\\nIncreasing inventory generally makes the supply chain more responsive to the customer.\\nA higher level of inventory also facilitates a reduction in production and transportation costs because of improved economies of scale in both functions.\\nThis choice, however, increases inventory holding cost.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that transportation plays in the supply chain and key transportation-related decisions that supply chain managers must make.\\nRole in the Supply Chain Transportation moves product between different stages in a supply chain and impacts both responsiveness and efficiency.\\nFaster transportation allows a supply chain to be more responsive but reduces its efficiency.\\nThe type of transportation a company uses also affects the inventory and facility locations in the supply chain.\\nDell, for example, flies some components from Asia because doing so allows the company to lower the level of inventory it holds.\\nClearly, such a practice also increases responsiveness but decreases transportation efficiency because it is more costly than transporting parts by ship.\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy Transportation allows a firm to adjust the location of its facilities and inventory to find the right balance between responsiveness and efficiency.\\nA firm selling high-value items such as pacemakers may use rapid transportation to be responsive while centralizing its facilities and inventory to lower cost.\\nIn contrast, a firm selling low-value, high-demand items like light bulbs may carry a fair amount of inventory close to the customer but then use low-cost transportation like sea, rail, and full trucks to replenish this inventory from plants located in low-cost countries.\\nEXAMPLE 3-3 Blue Nile Blue Nile is an online retailer of diamonds that has used responsive transportation with FedEx to ship diamonds to customers in the United States, Canada, and several countries in Europe and Asia.\\nGiven the high value of diamonds, Blue Nile offers free shipping for the overnight delivery.\\nResponsive shipping, however, allows Blue Nile to centralize its inventory of diamonds and also eliminate the need for expensive storefronts.\\nIn spite of the high transportation costs, Blue Nile has very low costs compared to bricks-and-mortar retailers because of the low facility and inventory expenses.\\nBlue Nile is thus able to offer significantly lower prices than its bricks-and-mortar competition.\\nComponents of Transportation Decisions We now identify key components of transportation that companies must analyze when designing and operating a supply chain.\\nDESIGN OF TRANSPORTATION NETWORK The transportation network is the collection of transportation modes, locations, and routes along which product can be shipped.\\nA company must decide whether transportation from a supply source will be direct to the demand point or will go through intermediate consolidation points.\\nDesign decisions also include whether or not multiple supply or demand points will be included in a single run.\\nCHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION MODE The mode of transportation is the manner in which a product is moved from one location in the supply chain network to another.\\nCompanies can choose among air, truck, rail, sea, and pipeline as modes of transport for products.\\nToday, information goods can also be sent via the Internet.\\nEach mode has different characteristics with respect to the speed, size of shipments (individual parcels to pallets to full trucks to entire ships), cost of shipping, and flexibility that lead companies to choose one particular mode over the others.\\nTRANSPORTATION-RELATED METRICS Inbound transportation decisions impact the cost of goods sold while outbound transportation costs are part of the selling, general, and administrative  .\\nThus, transportation costs affect the profit margin.\\nA manager should track the following transportation-related metrics that influence supply chain performance: ?Average inbound transportation cost typically measures the cost of bringing product into a facility as a percentage of sales or cost of goods sold (COGS).\\nIdeally, this cost should be measured per unit brought in, but this can be difficult.\\nThe inbound transportation cost is generally included in COGS.\\nIt is useful to separate this cost by supplier.\\n?Average incoming shipment size measures the average number of units or dollars in each incoming shipment at a facility.\\n?Average inbound transportation cost per shipment measures the average transportation cost of each incoming delivery.\\nAlong with the incoming shipment size, this metric identifies opportunities for greater economies of scale in inbound transportation.\\n?Average outbound transportation cost measures the cost of sending product out of a facility to the customer.\\nIdeally, this cost should be measured per unit shipped, but it is often measured as a percentage of sales.\\nIt is useful to separate this metric by customer.\\n?Average outbound shipment size measures the average number of units or dollars on each outbound shipment at a facility.\\n?Average outbound transportation cost per shipment measures the average transportation cost of each outgoing delivery.\\nAlong with the outgoing shipment size, this metric identifies opportunities for greater economies of scale in outbound transportation.\\n?Fraction transported by mode measures the fraction of transportation (in units or dollars) using each mode of transportation.\\nThis metric can be used to estimate if certain modes are overused or underutilized.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: RESPONSIVENESS VERSUS EFFICIENCY The fundamental trade-off for transportation is between the cost of transporting a given product (efficiency) and the speed with which that product is transported (responsiveness).\\nUsing fast modes of transport raises responsiveness and transportation cost but lowers the inventory holding cost.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that information plays in the supply chain, as well as key information-related decisions that supply chain managers must make.\\nRole in the Supply Chain Good information can help improve the utilization of supply chain assets and the coordination of supply chain flows to increase responsiveness and reduce costs.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan uses information to improve product availability while decreasing inventories.\\nWal-Mart uses information on shipments from suppliers to facilitate cross-docking and lower inventory and transportation expense.\\nLi & Fung, a global trading group supplying time-sensitive consumer goods such as apparel, uses information on its third party manufacturers to source each order from the most appropriate supplier.\\nAirlines routinely use information to offer the right number of seats at a discount price, leaving sufficient seats for business customers making reservations at the last minute and willing to pay a higher price.\\nEach of these examples illustrates the importance of information as a key driver that can be used to provide higher responsiveness while simultaneously improving efficiency.\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy The right information can help a supply chain better meet customer needs at lower cost.\\nThe appropriate investment in information technology improves visibility of transactions and coordination of decisions across the supply chain.\\nCoordination is essential if all stages of the  .\\nsupply chain are to work together toward a common goal.\\nThe goal in general should be to share the minimum amount of information required to achieve coordination because, beyond a certain point, the marginal cost of handling additional information increases, whereas the marginal benefit from the additional information decreases.\\nThe following examples illustrate how information can be used to provide customized products and improve supply chain performance.\\nEXAMPLE 3-4 Andersen Windows Andersen Windows, a major manufacturer of residential wood windows located in Bayport, Minnesota, has invested in an information system that enables the company to bring customized products to the market rapidly.\\nThis system, called \"Window of Knowledge,\" allows distributors and customers to design windows to custom-fit their needs.\\nUsers can select from a library of more than 50,000 components that can be combined in any number of ways.\\nThe system immediately gives the customer price quotes and automatically sends the order to the factory if the customer decides to buy.\\nThis information investment not only gives the customer a much wider variety of products, it also allows Andersen to be much more responsive to the customer, as it gets the customer\\'s order to the factory as soon as the order is placed.\\nEXAMPLE 3-5 Sunsweet Growers Sunsweet Growers, a California-based dried fruit producer, implemented a supply chain sales and operations planning (S&OP) suite to replace its Excel-based planning system.\\nThe company has a highly seasonal supply with harvest taking place primarily during September and October.\\nDemand is also seasonal with peak times occurring during the Christmas period.\\nGood planning thus can be very valuable.\\nSunsweet\\'s goal when implementing the suite was twofold: Each function should operate with the same data and an early warning capability should alert planners and managers about any potential mismatches in supply and demand.\\nAfter the implementation, production overruns at Sunsweet dropped from 30 percent to under 15 percent.\\nForecast accuracy improved by 15 to 20 percent.\\nThe early warning system alerts allowed planners to react as much as two to three weeks earlier than before the implementation.\\nComponents of Information Decisions We now consider key components of information that a company must analyze to increase efficiency and improve responsiveness within its supply chain.\\nPUSH VERSUS PULL When designing processes of the supply chain, managers must determine whether these processes are part of the push or pull phase in the chain.\\nWe discussed this distinction in Chapter 1, but we mention it again because different types of systems require different types of information.\\nPush systems start with forecasts that are used to build the master production schedule and roll it back, creating schedules for suppliers with part types, quantities, and delivery dates.\\nPull systems require information on actual demand to be transmitted extremely quickly throughout the entire chain so that production and distribution of products can reflect the real demand accurately.\\nCOORDINATION AND INFORMATION SHARING Supply chain coordination occurs when all stages of a supply chain work toward the objective of maximizing total supply chain profitability based on shared information.\\nLack of coordination can result in a significant loss of supply chain surplus.\\nCoordination among different stages in a supply chain requires each stage to share appropriate  .\\ninformation with other stages.\\nFor example, if a supplier is to produce the right parts in a timely manner for a manufacturer in a pull system, the manufacturer must share demand and production information with the supplier.\\nInformation sharing is thus crucial to the success of a supply chain.\\nSALES AND OPERATIONS PLANNING Sales and operations planning (S&OP) is the process of creating an overall supply plan (production and inventories) to meet the anticipated level of demand (sales).\\nThe S&OP process starts with sales and marketing communicating their needs to the supply chain, which in turn communicates to sales and marketing whether the needs can be met and at what cost.\\nThe goal of S&OP is to come up with an agreed-upon sales, production, and inventory plan that can be used to plan supply chain needs and project revenues and profits.\\nThe sales and operations plan becomes a critical piece of information to be shared across the supply chain because it affects both the demand on a firm\\'s suppliers and the supply to its customers.\\nENABLING TECHNOLOGIES Many technologies exist to share and analyze information in the supply chain.\\nManagers must decide which technologies to use and how to integrate them into their supply chain.\\nSome of these technologies include the following: 1.\\nElectronic data interchange (EDI) was developed in the 1970s to facilitate the placement of instantaneous, paperless purchase orders with suppliers.\\nIts proprietary nature, however, required significant upfront investment and often some translation between the communicating parties.\\nIt did make transactions faster and more accurate than when they were paper based.\\nRelative to EDI, the Internet conveys much more information using a standard infrastructure allowing supply chains to improve both efficiency and responsiveness.\\nThe beginning of the 21st century has seen the Internet become the dominant medium of communication across all the macro processes (CRM, ISCM, and SRM discussed in Chapter 1) that link the supply chain from suppliers to customers.\\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide the transactional tracking and global visibility of information from within a company and across its supply chain.\\nThis real-time information helps a supply chain improve the quality of its operational decisions.\\nERP systems keep track of the information, whereas the Internet provides one method with which to view this information.\\nA more detailed discussion of ERP systems is in Chapter 17.\\nSupply chain management (SCM) software uses the information in ERP systems to provide analytical decision support in addition to the visibility of information.\\nERP systems show a company what is going on, while SCM systems help a company decide what it should do.\\nA more detailed discussion of SCM systems is in Chapter 17.\\nRadio frequency identification (RFID) consists of an active or passive radio frequency (RF) tag applied to the item being tracked and an RF reader/emitter.\\nA passive tag draws energy from the reader, whereas an active tag has its own battery and draws power from it.\\nRFID has many potential uses.\\nIt can be used in manufacturing to check availability of the entire bill of materials.\\nThe technology can make the receiving of a truck much faster and cheaper.\\nFull implementation of RFID could eliminate the need for manual counting and bar-code scanning at the receiving dock.\\nIt can also be used to get an exact count of incoming items and items in storage.\\nRFID technology, however, has yet to reach 100 percent accuracy, and its cost per unit is still high enough to make global acceptance difficult, even at the case level.\\nINFORMATION-RELATED METRICS A manager should track the following information-related metrics that influence supply chain performance: ?Forecast horizon identifies how far in advance of the actual event a forecast is made.\\nThe forecast horizon must be greater than or equal to the lead time of the decision that is driven by the forecast.\\n?Frequency of update identifies how frequently each forecast is updated.\\nThe forecast should be updated somewhat more frequently than a decision will be revisited, so that large changes can be flagged and corrective action taken.\\n?Forecast error measures the difference between the forecast and actual demand.\\nThe forecast error is a measure of uncertainty and drives all responses to uncertainty such as safety inventory or excess capacity.\\n?Seasonal factors measure the extent to which the average demand in a season is above or below the average in the year.\\n?Variance from plan identifies the difference between the planned production/inventories and the actual values.\\nThese variances can be used to raise flags that identify shortages and surpluses.\\n?Ratio of demand variability to order variability measures the standard deviation of incoming demand and supply orders placed.\\nA ratio less than one potentially indicates the existence of the bullwhip effect, which is discussed in Chapter 10.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: COMPLEXITY VERSUS VALUE Good information clearly helps a firm improve both its efficiency and responsiveness.\\nThere is a danger, however, in the assumption that more information is always better.\\nAs more information is shared across a supply chain, the complexity and cost of both the required infrastructure and the follow-up analysis grow exponentially.\\nThe marginal value provided by the information shared, however, diminishes as more and more information is available.\\nIt is thus important to evaluate the minimum information required to accomplish the desired objectives.\\nFor example, it may often be enough if aggregate sales are shared between a retailer and a manufacturer instead of detailed point-of-sale data.\\nAggregate information is cheaper to share and provides most of the value with regard to better production planning.\\nThe trade-off between complexity and value is important to consider when setting up the information infrastructure.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that sourcing plays in the supply chain and key sourcing-related decisions that managers need to make.\\nRole in the Supply Chain Sourcing is the set of business processes required to purchase goods and services.\\nManagers must first decide whether each task will be performed by a responsive or efficient source and then whether the source will be internal to the company or a third party.\\nSourcing from low-cost countries allows a company like IKEA to provide the basic modules for the furniture it sells at low cost.\\nSourcing some of its PCs sold at Wal-Mart from China has allowed Dell to lower their cost.\\nMeanwhile, Dell continues to produce in-house those machines for which responsiveness is required.\\nAs supply chains have globalized, many more sourcing options now offer both considerable opportunity and potential risks.\\nThus, sourcing decisions have a significant impact on supply chain performance.\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy Sourcing decisions are crucial because they affect the level of efficiency and responsiveness the supply chain can achieve.\\nIn some instance, firms outsource to responsive third parties if it is too expensive for them to develop this responsiveness on their own.\\nAn example is the outsourcing of next-day package delivery by all firms to a few package carriers because it is too expensive for a firm to develop next-day delivery capability on its own.\\nIn other instances, firms have kept the responsive process in-house to maintain control.\\nAn example is Zara,  .\\nwhich keeps responsive capacity in-house so it can respond quickly to orders as they arrive.\\nFirms also outsource for efficiency if the third party can achieve significant economies of scale or has a lower underlying cost structure for other reasons.\\nThe following example illustrates how Cisco has sourced appropriately to be efficient for low-end products and responsive for high-end products.\\nEXAMPLE 3-6 Cisco Cisco has outsourced almost all of its manufacturing.\\nIt does, however, have a sourcing strategy that varies by product type.\\nFor low-end products such as routers for home networks, Cisco aims for efficiency.\\nThese routers are produced and packed in China and shipped in bulk for sale in the United States.\\nCisco aims for the lowest cost manufacturing location and economies of scale in transportation because the targeted market segment values low cost.\\nFor high-end products, in contrast, Cisco outsources to contract manufacturers in the United States.\\nThese manufacturers are not low cost, but they are responsive and can serve the rapidly evolving needs of the high-end market.\\nComponents of Sourcing Decisions We now consider key sourcing decisions that are made within a firm.\\nIN-HOUSE OR OUTSOURCE The most significant sourcing decision for a firm is whether to perform a task in-house or outsource it to a third party.\\nWithin a task such as transportation, managers must decide whether to outsource all of it, outsource only the responsive component, or outsource only the efficient component.\\nThis decision should be driven in part by its impact on the total supply chain surplus.\\nIt is best to outsource if the growth in total supply chain surplus is significant with little additional risk.\\nSUPPLIER SELECTION Managers must decide on the number of suppliers they will have for a particular activity.\\nThey must then identify the criteria along which suppliers will be evaluated and how they will be selected.\\nFor the selection process, managers must decide whether they will use direct negotiations or resort to an auction.\\nIf an auction is used, it must be structured to ensure the desired outcome.\\nPROCUREMENT Procurement is the process of obtaining goods and services within a supply chain.\\nManagers must structure procurement with a goal of increasing supply chain surplus.\\nFor example, a firm should set up procurement for direct materials to ensure good coordination between the supplier and buyer.\\nIn contrast, the procurement of MRO products should be structured to ensure that transaction costs are low.\\nSOURCING-RELATED METRICS Sourcing decisions directly impact the cost of goods sold and accounts payable.\\nThe performance of the source also impacts quality, inventories, and inbound transportation costs.\\nA manager should track the following sourcing-related metrics that influence supply chain performance: ?Days payable outstanding measures the number of days between when a supplier performed a supply chain task and when it was paid.\\n?Average purchase price measures the average price at which a good or service was purchased during the year.\\nThe average price should be weighted by the quantity purchased at each price.\\n?Range of purchase price measures the fluctuation in purchase price during a specified period.\\nThe goal is to identify if the quantity purchased correlated with the price.\\n?Average purchase quantity measures the average amount purchased per order.\\nThe goal is to identify whether a sufficient level of aggregation is occurring across locations when placing an order.\\n?Supply quality measures the quality of product supplied.\\n?Supply lead time measures the average time between when an order is placed and when the product arrives.\\nLong lead times reduce responsiveness and add to the inventory the supply chain must carry.\\n?Fraction of on-time deliveries measures the fraction of deliveries from the supplier that were on time.\\n?Supplier reliability measures the variability of the supplier\\'s lead time as well as the delivered quantity relative to plan.\\nPoor supplier reliability hurts responsiveness and adds to the amount of inventory the supply chain must carry.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: INCREASE THE SUPPLY CHAIN SURPLUS Sourcing decisions should be made to increase the size of the total surplus to be shared across the supply chain.\\nThe total surplus is affected by the impact of sourcing on sales, service, production costs, inventory costs, transportation costs, and information costs.\\nOutsourcing to a third party is meaningful if the third party raises the supply chain surplus more than the firm can on its own.\\nIn contrast, a firm should keep a supply chain function in-house if the third party cannot increase the supply chain surplus or if the risk associated with outsourcing is significant.\\nIn this section, we discuss the role that pricing plays in the supply chain.\\nRole in the Supply Chain Pricing is the process by which a firm decides how much to charge customers for its goods and services.\\nPricing affects the customer segments that choose to buy the product, as well as the customer\\'s expectations.\\nThis directly affects the supply chain in terms of the level of responsiveness required as well as the demand profile that the supply chain attempts to serve.\\nPricing is also a lever that can be used to match supply and demand especially when the supply chain is not very flexible.\\nShort-term discounts can be used to eliminate supply surpluses or decrease seasonal demand spikes by moving some of the demand forward.\\nIn short, pricing is one of the most significant factors that affect the level and type of demand that the supply chain will face.\\nRole in the Competitive Strategy Pricing is a significant attribute through which a firm executes its competitive strategy.\\nFor example, Costco, a membership-based wholesaler in the United States, has a policy that prices are kept steady but low.\\nCustomers expect low prices but are comfortable with a lower level of product availability.\\nThe steady prices also ensure that demand stays relatively stable.\\nCostco serves a well-defined segment, and it can thus design an appropriate supply chain.\\nThe Costco supply chain aims to be efficient, at the expense of some responsiveness.\\nIn contrast, some manufacturing and transportation firms use pricing that varies with the response time desired by the customer.\\nThrough their pricing, these firms are targeting a broader set of customers, some of whom need responsiveness while others need efficiency.\\nIn this case, it becomes important for these firms to structure a supply chain that can meet the two divergent needs.\\nAmazon uses a menu of shipping options and prices to identify customers who value responsiveness and those who value low cost.\\nThis identification allows the company to serve both effectively, as shown in the following example.\\nEXAMPLE 3-7 Amazon.com .\\nComponents of Pricing Decisions We now describe key components of pricing decisions that affect supply chain performance.\\nPRICING AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE Most supply chain activities display economies of scale.\\nChangeovers make small production runs more expensive per unit than large production runs.\\nLoading and unloading costs make it cheaper to deliver a truckload to one location than four.\\nIn each case, the provider of the supply chain activity must decide how to price it appropriately to reflect these economies of scale.\\nA commonly used approach is to offer quantity discounts.\\nCare must be taken to ensure that quantity discounts offered are consistent with the economies of scale in the underlying process.\\nOtherwise, there is a danger of customer orders being driven primarily by the quantity discounts even though the underlying process does not have significant economies of scale.\\nEVERYDAY LOW PRICING VERSUS HIGH胎OW PRICING A firm such as Costco practices everyday low pricing at its warehouse stores, keeping prices steady over time.\\nCostco will go to the extent of not offering any discount on damaged books to ensure its everyday low-pricing strategy.\\nIn contrast, most supermarkets practice high衍ow pricing and offer steep discounts on a subset of their product every week.\\nThe Costco pricing strategy results in relatively stable demand.\\nThe high衍ow pricing strategy results in a peak during the discount week, often followed by a steep drop in demand during the following weeks.\\nThe two pricing strategies lead to different demand profiles that the supply chain must serve.\\nFIXED PRICE VERSUS MENU PRICING A firm must decide whether it will charge a fixed price for its supply chain activities or have a menu with prices that vary with some other attribute, such as the response time or location of delivery.\\nIf marginal supply chain costs or the value to the customer vary significantly along some attribute, it is often effective to have a pricing menu.\\nWe have already discussed Amazon as an example of a firm offering a menu that is somewhat consistent with the cost of providing the particular supply chain service.\\nAn example of when the pricing menu is somewhat inconsistent is seen at many MRO suppliers.\\nThey often allow customers to have their order shipped to them or to be picked up in person.\\nA customer pays an additional shipping fee for home delivery but pays nothing for a personal pickup.\\nThe pick, pack, and deliver cost at the warehouse, however, is higher in the case of a personal pickup compared to home delivery.\\nThe pricing policy thus can lead to customer behavior that has a negative impact on profits.\\nPRICING-RELATED METRICS Pricing directly affects revenues but can also affect production costs and inventories depending upon its impact on consumer demand.\\nA manager should track  .\\nthe following pricing-related metrics.\\nWith menu pricing, each metric should be tracked separately for each segment in the menu: ?Profit margin measures profit as a percentage of revenue.\\nA firm needs to examine a wide variety of profit margin metrics to optimize its pricing, including dimensions such as type of margin (gross, net, etc.\\n), scope (SKU, product line, division, firm), customer type, and others.\\n?Days sales outstanding measures the average time between when a sale is made and when the cash is collected.\\n?Incremental fixed cost per order measures the incremental costs that are independent of the size of the order.\\nThese include changeover costs at a manufacturing plant or order processing or transportation costs that are incurred independent of shipment size at a mail-order firm.\\n?Incremental variable cost per unit measures the incremental costs that vary with the size of the order.\\nThese include picking costs at a mail-order firm or variable production costs at a manufacturing plant.\\n?Average sale price measures the average price at which a supply chain activity was performed in a given period.\\nThe average should be obtained by weighting the price with the quantity sold at that price.\\n?Average order size measures the average quantity per order.\\nThe average sale price, order size, incremental fixed cost per order, and incremental variable cost per unit help estimate the contribution from performing the supply chain activity.\\n?Range of sale price measures the maximum and the minimum of sale price per unit over a specified time horizon.\\n?Range of periodic sales measures the maximum and minimum of the quantity sold per period (day/week/month) during a specified time horizon.\\nThe goal is to understand any correlation between sales and price and any potential opportunity to shift sales by changing price over time.\\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: INCREASE FIRM PROFITS All pricing decisions should be made with the objective of increasing firm profits.\\nThis requires an understanding of the cost structure of performing a supply chain activity and the value this activity brings to the supply chain.\\nStrategies such as everyday low pricing may foster stable demand that allows for efficiency in the supply chain.\\nOther pricing strategies may lower supply chain costs, defend market share, or even steal market share.\\nDifferential pricing may be used to attract customers with varying needs, as long as this strategy helps either increase revenues or shrink costs, preferably both.\\nDescribe key financial measures of firm performance.\\nThe key financial measures of firm performance include return on equity; return on assets; accounts payable turnover; profit margin; asset turnover, accounts receivable turnover; inventory turns; property, plant and equipment turns; and cash-to-cash cycle.\\nIdentify the major drivers of supply chain performance.\\nThe major drivers of supply chain performance are facilities, inventory, transportation, information, sourcing, and pricing.\\nDiscuss the role of each driver in creating strategic fit between the supply chain strategy and the competitive strategy.\\nA company achieving strategic fit has found the right balance between responsiveness and efficiency.\\nEach driver affects this balance.\\nHaving more facilities generally makes a chain more responsive, while having fewer, central facilities creates higher efficiency.\\nHolding higher levels of inventory increases the responsiveness of a supply  .\\nchain, while keeping inventory low increases the chain\\'s efficiency.\\nUsing faster modes of transportation increases a chain\\'s responsiveness, while using slower modes generally increases efficiency.\\nInvesting in information can vastly improve the supply chain performance on both dimensions.\\nThis investment, however, must be made based on the strategic position supported by the other drivers.\\nAppropriate sourcing decisions raise supply chain profits by assigning supply chain functions to the right party, which brings higher economies of scale or a higher level of aggregation of uncertainty.\\nPricing can be used to attract the right target customer segment.\\nDifferential pricing can be used to attract customers who value responsiveness as well as customers who want efficiency.\\nThe supply chain can then be structured to provide responsiveness to some customers while improving overall efficiency.\\nDefine the key metrics that track the performance of the supply chain in terms of each driver.\\nFacility-related metrics are capacity, utilization, theoretical flow/cycle time of production, actual flow/cycle time, flow time efficiency, product variety, volume contribution of top 20 percent SKUs/customers, processing/setup/down/idle time, and average production batch size.\\nInventory-related metrics are average inventory, products with more than a specified number of days of inventory, average replenishment batch size, average safety inventory, seasonal inventory, fill rate, and fraction of time out of stock.\\nTransportation-related metrics are average inbound transportation cost, average incoming shipment size, average inbound transportation cost per shipment, average outbound transportation cost, average outbound shipment size, average outbound transportation cost per shipment, and fraction transported by mode.\\nInformation-related metrics are forecast horizon, forecast error, seasonal factors, variance from plan, and ratio of demand variability to order variability.\\nSourcing-related metrics are days payable outstanding, average purchase price, range of purchase price, average purchase quantity, fraction on-time deliveries, supply quality, and supply lead time.\\nPricing-related metrics are profit margin, days sales outstanding, incremental fixed cost per order, incremental variable cost per unit, average sale price, average order size, range of sale price, and range of periodic sales.\\nEach of these metrics directly or indirectly impacts the financial metrics and the responsiveness to customers.\\n Identify the key factors to be considered when designing a distribution network.\\nDiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of various distribution options.\\nUnderstand how online sales have affected the design of distribution networks in different industries.\\nIn this chapter, we provide an understanding of the role of distribution within a supply chain and identify factors that should be considered when designing a distribution network.\\nWe identify several potential designs for distribution networks and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each option.\\nWe apply these ideas to discuss the evolution of distribution networks in various industries since the advent of online sales.\\nOur goal is to provide managers with a logical framework for selecting the appropriate distribution network given product, competitive, and market characteristics.\\nDistribution refers to the steps taken to move and store a product from the supplier stage to a customer stage in the supply chain.\\nDistribution occurs between every pair of stages in the supply chain.\\nRaw materials and components are moved from suppliers to manufacturers, whereas finished products are moved from the manufacturer to the end consumer.\\nDistribution is a key driver of the overall profitability of a firm because it affects both the supply chain cost and the customer value directly.\\nIn the apparel retail industry, distribution impacts (including its influence on markdowns and lost sales) about 35 percent of the revenue.\\nIn India, the outbound distribution cost of cement is about 30 percent of the cost of producing and selling it.\\nIt would be no exaggeration to state that two of the world\\'s most profitable companies, Wal-Mart and Seven-Eleven Japan, have built the success of their entire business around outstanding distribution design and operation.\\nIn the case of Wal-Mart, distribution allows the company to provide high availability levels of relatively common products at a very low cost.\\nIn the case of Seven-Eleven Japan, effective distribution provides a very high level of customer responsiveness at a reasonable cost.\\nThe process of designing a distribution network has two broad phases.\\nIn the first phase, the broad structure of the supply chain network is visualized.\\nThis stage includes decisions such as whether the product will be sold directly or go through an intermediary.\\nThe second phase then takes the broad structure and converts it into specific locations and their capability, capacity, and demand allocation.\\nThis chapter focuses on issues that impact the design of the broad distribution network.\\nChapters 5 and 6 focus on the second phase that starts with the broad network and results in a specific supply chain network.\\nThe appropriate distribution network can be used to achieve a variety of supply chain objectives ranging from low cost to high responsiveness.\\nAs a result, companies in the same industry often select different distribution networks.\\nNext, we discuss industry examples that highlight the variety of distribution network choices and the issues that arise when selecting among these options.\\nUntil 2007, Dell distributed its PCs directly to end consumers, whereas companies such as HP distributed through resellers.\\nDell customers waited several days to get a PC, whereas customers could walk away with an HP computer from a reseller.\\nStarting in June 2007, Dell also started selling its PCs through retailers such as Wal-Mart.\\nIn the late 1990s, Gateway opened Gateway Country stores, wherein customers could examine the products and have salespeople help them configure a PC that suited their needs.\\nGateway, however, chose to sell no products at the stores; all PCs were shipped directly from the factory to the customer.\\nBy April 2004, Gateway closed all its stores because of their poor financial performance.\\nApple Computer, in contrast, has opened many retail stores that sell computers.\\nThese PC companies have chosen different distribution models.\\nHow can we evaluate this wide range of distribution choices?\\nWhich ones serve the companies and their customers better?\\nP&G has chosen to distribute directly to large supermarket chains while obligating smaller players to buy P&G products from distributors.\\nProducts move directly from P&G to the larger chains but move through an additional stage when going to smaller supermarkets.\\nTexas Instruments, which once used only direct sales, now sells about 30 percent of its volume to 98 percent of its customers through distributors, while serving the remaining 2 percent of customers with 70 percent of the volume directly.1 What value do these distributors provide?\\nWhen should a distribution network include an additional stage such as a distributor?\\nDistributors play a much more significant role for consumer goods distribution in a country such as India compared to the United States.\\nWhy might this be the case?\\nW.W. Grainger stocks about 200,000 SKUs that can be sent to customers within a day of order placement.\\nThe remaining slower moving products are not stocked but instead are shipped directly from the manufacturer when a customer places an order.\\nIt takes several days for the customer to receive the product in this case.\\nAre these distribution choices appropriate?\\nHow can they be justified?\\nAs the preceding examples illustrate, firms can make many choices when designing their distribution network.\\nAn inappropriate network can have a significant negative effect on the profitability of the firm, as is evident in the failure of companies such as Blockbuster and Webvan.\\nThe appropriate choice of distribution network grows the supply chain surplus by satisfying customer needs at the lowest possible cost.\\nIn the next section, we identify performance measures that need to be considered when designing the distribution network.\\nAt the highest level, performance of a distribution network should be evaluated along two dimensions: 1.\\nCustomer needs that are met 2.\\nCost of meeting customer needs Thus, a firm must evaluate the impact on customer service and cost as it compares different distribution network options.\\nThe customer needs that are met influence the company\\'s revenues, which along with cost decide the profitability of the delivery network.\\nAlthough customer value is impacted by many factors, we focus on those measures that are influenced by the structure of the distribution network: ?Response time ?Product variety ?Product availability 1 A Tale of Two Electronic Component Distributors, Ananth Raman and Bharat P. Rao, Harvard Business School Case 9?97?64, 1997.  .\\n?Customer experience ?Time to market ?Order visibility ?Returnability Response time is the amount of time it takes for a customer to receive an order.\\nProduct variety is the number of different products/configurations that are offered by the distribution network.\\nProduct availability is the probability of having a product in stock when a customer order arrives.\\nCustomer experience includes the ease with which customers can place and receive orders and the extent to which this experience is customized.\\nIt also includes purely experiential aspects, such as the possibility of getting a cup of coffee and the value that the sales staff provides.\\nTime to market is the time it takes to bring a new product to the market.\\nOrder visibility is the ability of customers to track their orders from placement to delivery.\\nReturnability is the ease with which a customer can return unsatisfactory merchandise and the ability of the network to handle such returns.\\nIt may seem at first that a customer always wants the highest level of performance along all these dimensions.\\nIn practice, however, this is not the case.\\nCustomers ordering a book at Amazon are willing to wait longer than those who drive to a nearby Barnes & Noble store to get the same book.\\nIn contrast, customers can find a much larger variety of books at Amazon compared to the Barnes & Noble store.\\nThus, Amazon customers trade off fast response times for high levels of variety.\\nFirms that target customers who can tolerate a long response time require only a few locations that may be far from the customer.\\nThese companies can focus on increasing the capacity of each location.\\nIn contrast, firms that target customers who value short response times need to locate facilities close to them.\\nThese firms must have many facilities, each with a low capacity.\\nThus, a decrease in the response time customers desire increases the number of facilities required in the network, as shown in Figure 4-1.\\nFor example, Barnes & Noble provides its customers with books on the same day but requires hundreds of stores to achieve this goal for most of the United States.\\nAmazon, in contrast, takes a few days to deliver a book to its U.S. customers, but it uses about 20 locations to store its books.\\nChanging the distribution network design affects the following supply chain costs (notice that these are four of the six supply chain drivers we discussed earlier): ?Inventories ?Transportation ?Facilities and handling ?Information The other two drivers, sourcing and pricing, also affect the choice of the distribution system; the link will be discussed when relevant.\\nAs the number of facilities in a supply chain increases, the inventory and resulting inventory costs also increase (see Chapter 12), as shown in Figure 4-2.\\nRequired Number of Facilities  Desired Response Time  .\\nNumber of Facilities .\\nTo decrease inventory costs, firms try to consolidate and limit the number of facilities in their supply chain network.\\nFor example, with fewer facilities, Amazon is able to turn its inventory about 10 times a year, whereas Barnes & Noble, with hundreds of facilities, achieves only about 3 turns per year.\\nInbound transportation costs are the costs incurred in bringing material into a facility.\\nOutbound transportation costs are the costs of sending material out of a facility.\\nOutbound transportation costs per unit tend to be higher than inbound costs because inbound lot sizes are typically larger.\\nFor example, an Amazon warehouse receives full truckload shipments of books on the inbound side, but ships out small packages with only a few books per customer on the outbound side.\\nIncreasing the number of warehouse locations decreases the average outbound distance to the customer and makes outbound transportation distance a smaller fraction of the total distance traveled by the product.\\nThus, as long as inbound transportation economies of scale are maintained, increasing the number of facilities decreases total transportation cost, as shown in Figure 4-3.\\nIf the number of facilities is increased to a point where inbound lot sizes are also very small and result in a significant loss of economies of scale in inbound transportation, increasing the number of facilities increases total transportation cost, as shown in Figure 4-3.\\nTransportation Cost  Number of Facilities  .\\nNumber of Facilities .\\nFacility costs decrease as the number of facilities is reduced, as shown in Figure 4-4, because a consolidation of facilities allows a firm to exploit economies of scale.\\nWhile Amazon achieved a property, plant, and equipment turnover (PPET) of 19 in 2009, Barnes & Noble had a PPET of just over 7.\\nTotal logistics costs are the sum of inventory, transportation, and facility costs for a supply chain network.\\nAs the number of facilities increases, total logistics costs first decrease and then increase as shown in Figure 4-5.\\nEach firm should have at least the number of facilities that minimizes total logistics costs.\\nAmazon has more than one warehouse primarily to reduce its logistics costs (and improve response time).\\nIf a firm wants to reduce the response time to its customers further, it may have to increase the number of facilities beyond the point that minimizes logistics costs.\\nA firm should add facilities beyond the cost-minimizing point only if managers are confident that the increase in revenues because of better responsiveness is greater than the increase in costs because of the additional facilities.\\nResponse Time Total Logistics Cost  Number of Facilities  .\\nThe customer service and cost components listed earlier are the primary measures used to evaluate different delivery network designs.\\nIn general, no distribution network will outperform others along all dimensions.\\nThus, it is important to ensure that the strengths of the distribution network fit with the strategic position of the firm.\\nIn the next section, we discuss various distribution networks and their relative strengths and weaknesses.\\nWill product be delivered to the customer location or picked up from a prearranged site?\\nWill product flow through an intermediary (or intermediate location)?\\nBased on the firm\\'s industry and the answers to these two questions, one of six distinct distribution network designs may be used to move products from factory to customer.\\nThese designs are classified as follows: 1.\\nManufacturer storage with direct shipping 2.\\nManufacturer storage with direct shipping and in-transit merge 3.\\nDistributor storage with carrier delivery 4.\\nDistributor storage with last-mile delivery 5.\\nManufacturer/distributor storage with customer pickup 6.\\nRetail storage with customer pickup Manufacturer Storage with Direct Shipping In this option, product is shipped directly from the manufacturer to the end customer, bypassing the retailer (who takes the order and initiates the delivery request).\\nThis option is also referred to as drop-shipping.\\nThe retailer carries no inventory.\\nInformation flows from the customer, via the retailer, to the manufacturer, and product is shipped directly from the manufacturer to customers as shown in Figure 4-6.\\nOnline retailers such as eBags and Nordstrom.com use drop-shipping to deliver goods to the end consumer.\\neBags holds few bags in inventory.\\nNordstrom carries some products in inventory and uses the drop-ship model for slow-moving footwear.\\nW.W. Grainger also uses drop-shipping to deliver slow-moving items to customers.\\nThe biggest advantage of drop-shipping is the ability to centralize inventories at the manufacturer who can aggregate demand across all retailers that it supplies.\\nAs a result, the supply chain is Manufacturers Retailer Customers Product Flow Information Flow .\\nable to provide a high level of product availability with lower levels of inventory.\\nA key issue with regard to drop-shipping is the ownership structure of the inventory at the manufacturer.\\nIf specified portions of inventory at the manufacturer are allocated to individual retailers, there is little benefit of aggregation even though the inventory is physically aggregated.\\nBenefit of aggregation is achieved only if the manufacturer can allocate at least a portion of the available inventory across retailers on an as-needed basis.\\nThe benefits from centralization are highest for high-value, lowdemand items with unpredictable demand.\\nThe decision of Nordstrom to drop-ship low-demand shoes satisfies these criteria.\\nSimilarly, bags sold by eBags tend to have high value and relatively low demand per SKU.\\nThe inventory benefits of aggregation are small for items with predictable demand and low value.\\nThus, drop-shipping does not offer a significant inventory advantage to an online grocer selling a staple item such as detergent.\\nFor slow-moving items, inventory turns can increase by a factor of six or higher if drop-shipping is used instead of storage at retail stores.\\nDrop-shipping also offers the manufacturer the opportunity to postpone customization until after a customer has placed an order.\\nPostponement, if implemented, further lowers inventories by aggregating to the component level.\\nFor its customized machines, Dell holds inventories as common components and postpones product customization, thus lowering the level of inventory carried.\\nAlthough inventory costs are typically low with drop-shipping, transportation costs are high because the average outbound distance to the end consumer is large, and package carriers are used to ship the product.\\nPackage carriers have high shipping costs per unit compared to truckload or less-than-truckload carriers.\\nWith drop-shipping, a customer order including items from several manufacturers will involve multiple shipments to the customer.\\nThis loss in aggregation of outbound transportation increases cost.\\nSupply chains save on the fixed cost of facilities when using drop-shipping because all inventories are centralized at the manufacturer.\\nThis eliminates the need for other warehousing space in the supply chain.\\nThere can be some savings of handling costs as well, because the transfer from manufacturer to retailer no longer occurs.\\nHandling cost savings must be evaluated carefully, however, because the manufacturer is now required to transfer items to the factory warehouse in full cases and then ship out from the warehouse in single units.\\nThe inability of a manufacturer to develop single-unit delivery capabilities can have a significant negative effect on handling cost and response time.\\nHandling costs can be reduced significantly if the manufacturer has the capability to ship orders directly from the production line.\\nA good information infrastructure is needed between the retailers and the manufacturer so that the retailer can provide product availability information to the customer, even though the inventory is located at the manufacturer.\\nThe customer should also have visibility into order processing at the manufacturer, even with the order being placed with the retailer.\\nDrop-shipping generally requires significant investment in information infrastructure.\\nThe information infrastructure requirement is somewhat simpler for direct sellers like Dell because two stages (retailer and manufacturer) do not need to be integrated.\\nResponse times tend to be long when drop-shipping is used because the order has to be transmitted from the retailer to the manufacturer and shipping distances are generally longer from the manufacturer\\'s centralized site.\\neBags, for example, states that order processing may take from 1 to 5 days and ground transportation after that may take from 3 to 11 business days.\\nThis implies that customer response time at eBags will be 4 to 16 days using ground transportation and drop-shipping.\\nAnother issue is that the response time need not be identical for every manufacturer that is part of a customer order.\\nGiven an order containing products from several sources, the customer will receive multiple partial shipments over time, making receiving more complicated for the customer.\\nManufacturer storage allows a high level of product variety to be available to the customer.\\nWith a drop-shipping model, every product at the manufacturer can be made available to the customer without any limits imposed by shelf space.\\nW.W. Grainger is able to offer hundreds of thousands of slow-moving items from thousands of manufacturers using drop-shipping.\\nThis would be impossible if each product had to be stored by W.W. Grainger.\\nDrop-shipping allows a new product to be available to the market the day the first unit is produced.\\nDrop-shipping provides a good customer experience in the form of delivery to the customer location.\\nThe experience, however, suffers when a single order containing products from several manufacturers is delivered in partial shipments.\\nOrder visibility is important in the context of manufacturer storage, because two stages in the supply chain are involved in every customer order.\\nFailure to provide this capability is likely to have a significant negative effect on customer satisfaction.\\nOrder tracking, however, becomes harder to implement in a drop-ship system because it requires complete integration of information systems at both the retailer and the manufacturer.\\nFor direct sellers such as Dell, order visibility is simpler to provide.\\nA manufacturer storage network is likely to have difficulty handling returns, hurting customer satisfaction.\\nThe handling of returns is more expensive under drop-shipping because each order may involve shipments from more than one manufacturer.\\nReturns can be handled in two ways.\\nOne is for the customer to return the product directly to the manufacturer.\\nThe second approach is for the retailer to set up a separate facility (across all manufacturers) to handle returns.\\nThe first approach incurs high transportation and coordination costs, whereas the second approach requires investment in a facility to handle returns.\\nThe performance characteristics of drop-shipping along various dimensions are summarized in Table 4-1.\\nTable 4-1 Performance Characteristics of Manufacturer Storage with Direct Shipping Network  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information Service Factor  Lower costs because of aggregation.\\nBenefits of aggregation are highest for low-demand, high-value items.\\nBenefits are large if product customization can be postponed at the manufacturer.\\nHigher transportation costs because of increased distance and disaggregate shipping.\\nLower facility costs because of aggregation.\\nSome saving on handling costs if manufacturer can manage small shipments or ship from production line.\\nSignificant investment in information infrastructure to integrate manufacturer and retailer.\\nPerformance  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Returnability  Long response time of one to two weeks because of increased distance and two stages for order processing.\\nResponse time may vary by product, thus complicating receiving.\\nEasy to provide a high level of variety.\\nEasy to provide a high level of product availability because of aggregation at manufacturer.\\nGood in terms of home delivery but can suffer if order from several manufacturers is sent as partial shipments.\\nFast, with the product available as soon as the first unit is produced.\\nMore difficult but also more important from a customer service perspective.\\nExpensive and difficult to implement.\\nGiven its performance characteristics, manufacturer storage with direct shipping is best suited for a large variety of low-demand, high-value items for which customers are willing to wait for delivery and accept several partial shipments.\\nManufacturer storage is also suitable if it allows the manufacturer to postpone customization, thus reducing inventories.\\nIt is thus ideal for direct sellers that are able to build-to-order.\\nFor drop-shipping to be effective, there should be few sourcing locations per order.\\nManufacturer Storage with Direct Shipping and In-Transit Merge Unlike pure drop-shipping, under which each product in the order is sent directly from its manufacturer to the end customer, in-transit merge combines pieces of the order coming from different locations so that the customer gets a single delivery.\\nInformation and product flows for the in-transit merge network are shown in Figure 4-7.\\nIn-transit merge has been used by Dell and can be used by companies implementing drop-shipping.\\nWhen a customer orders a PC from Dell along with a Sony monitor, the package carrier picks up the PC from the Dell factory and the monitor from the Sony factory; it then merges the two at a hub before making a single delivery to the customer.\\nAs with drop-shipping, the ability to aggregate inventories and postpone product customization is a significant advantage of in-transit merge.\\nIn-transit merge allows Dell and Sony to hold all their inventories at the factory.\\nThis approach has the greatest benefits for products with high value whose demand is difficult to forecast, particularly if product customization can be postponed.\\nAlthough an increase in coordination is required, merge in transit decreases transportation costs relative to drop-shipping by aggregating the final delivery.\\nFacility and processing costs for the manufacturer and the retailer are similar to those for drop-shipping.\\nThe party performing the in-transit merge has higher facility costs because of the merge capability required.\\nReceiving costs at the customer are lower because a single delivery is received.\\nOverall supply chain facility and handling costs are somewhat higher than with drop-shipping.\\nA sophisticated information infrastructure is needed to allow in-transit merge.\\nIn addition to information, operations at the retailer, manufacturers, and the carrier must be coordinated.\\nThe investment in information infrastructure is higher than that for drop-shipping.\\nResponse times, product variety, availability, and time to market are similar to dropshipping.\\nResponse times may be marginally higher because of the need to perform the merge.\\nCustomer experience is likely to be better than with drop-shipping, because the customer receives only one delivery for an order instead of many partial shipments.\\nOrder visibility is an important requirement.\\nAlthough the initial setup is difficult because it requires integration of manufacturer, carrier, and retailer, tracking itself becomes easier given the merge that occurs at the carrier hub.\\nFactories  Retailer  In-Transit Merge by Carrier  .\\nCustomers Product Flow Information Flow  .\\nTable 4-2 Performance Characteristics of In-Transit Merge  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information  Similar to drop-shipping.\\nSomewhat lower transportation costs than drop-shipping.\\nHandling costs higher than drop-shipping at carrier; receiving costs lower at customer.\\nInvestment is somewhat higher than for drop-shipping.\\nService Factor  Performance  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Returnability  Similar to drop-shipping; may be marginally higher.\\nSimilar to drop-shipping.\\nSimilar to drop-shipping.\\nBetter than drop-shipping because only a single delivery has to be received.\\nSimilar to drop-shipping Similar to drop-shipping.\\nSimilar to drop-shipping.\\nReturnability is similar to that with drop-shipping.\\nProblems in handling returns are likely, and the reverse supply chain will continue to be expensive and difficult to implement, as with drop-shipping.\\nThe performance of factory storage with in-transit merge is compared with that of drop-shipping in Table 4-2.\\nThe main advantages of in-transit merge over drop-shipping are lower transportation cost and improved customer experience.\\nThe major disadvantage is the additional effort during the merge itself.\\nGiven its performance characteristics, manufacturer storage with in-transit merge is best suited for low- to medium-demand, high-value items the retailer is sourcing from a limited number of manufacturers.\\nCompared to drop-shipping, in-transit merge requires a higher demand from each manufacturer (not necessarily each product) in order to be effective.\\nWhen there are too many sources, in-transit merge can be difficult to coordinate and implement.\\nIn-transit merge is best implemented if there are no more than four or five sourcing locations.\\nThe in-transit merge of a Dell PC with a Sony monitor is appropriate because product variety is high, but there are few sourcing locations with relatively large total demand from each sourcing location.\\nDistributor Storage with Carrier Delivery Under this option, inventory is not held by manufacturers at the factories but is held by distributors/retailers in intermediate warehouses, and package carriers are used to transport products from the intermediate location to the final customer.\\nAmazon and industrial distributors such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr have used this approach combined with drop-shipping from a manufacturer (or distributor).\\nInformation and product flows when using distributor storage with delivery by a package carrier are shown in Figure 4-8.\\nRelative to manufacturer storage, distributor storage requires a higher level of inventory because of a loss of aggregation.\\nFrom an inventory perspective, distributor storage makes sense for products with somewhat higher demand.\\nThis is seen in the operations of both Amazon and W.W. Grainger.\\nThey stock only the slow- to fast-moving items at their warehouses, with very slow-moving items stocked farther upstream.\\nIn some instances, postponement of product differentiation can be implemented with distributor storage, but it does require that the warehouse develop some assembly capability.\\nDistributor storage, however, requires much less  .\\nFactories  Warehouse Storage by Distributor/ Retailer Customers Product Flow Information Flow .\\ninventory than a retail network.\\nAmazon achieves about 10 turns of inventory annually using warehouse storage, whereas Barnes & Noble achieves about 3 turns using retail stores.\\nTransportation costs are somewhat lower for distributor storage compared to manufacturer storage because an economic mode of transportation (e.g., truckloads) can be employed for inbound shipments to the warehouse, which is closer to the customer.\\nUnlike manufacturer storage, under which multiple shipments may need to go out for a single customer order with multiple items, distributor storage allows outbound orders to the customer to be bundled into a single shipment, further reducing transportation cost.\\nDistributor storage provides savings on the transportation of faster moving items relative to manufacturer storage.\\nCompared to manufacturer storage, facility costs (of warehousing) are somewhat higher with distributor storage because of a loss of aggregation.\\nProcessing and handling costs are comparable to manufacturer storage unless the factory is able to ship to the end customer directly from the production line.\\nIn that case, distributor storage has higher processing costs.\\nFrom a facility cost perspective, distributor storage is not appropriate for extremely slow-moving items.\\nThe information infrastructure needed with distributor storage is significantly less complex than that needed with manufacturer storage.\\nThe distributor warehouse serves as a buffer between the customer and the manufacturer, decreasing the need to coordinate the two completely.\\nReal-time visibility between customers and the warehouse is needed, whereas real-time visibility between the customer and the manufacturer is not.\\nVisibility between the distributor warehouse and manufacturer can be achieved at a much lower cost than real-time visibility between the customer and manufacturer.\\nResponse time under distributor storage is better than under manufacturer storage because distributor warehouses are, on average, closer to customers, and the entire order is aggregated at the warehouse before being shipped.\\nAmazon, for example, processes most warehouse-stored items within a day and then it takes three to five business days using ground transportation for the order to reach the customer.\\nW.W. Grainger processes customer orders on the same day and has enough warehouses to deliver most orders the next day using ground transport.\\nWarehouse storage limits to some extent the variety of products that can be offered.\\nW.W. Grainger does not store very low-demand items at its warehouse, relying on manufacturers to drop-ship those products to the customer.\\nCustomer convenience is high with distributor storage because a single shipment reaches the customer in response to an order.\\nTime to market under distributor storage is somewhat higher than under manufacturer storage because of the need to stock another stage in the supply chain.\\nOrder visibility becomes easier than with manufacturer storage because there is a single shipment from the warehouse to the customer and only one stage of the supply chain is involved directly in filling the customer order.\\nReturnability is better than with manufacturer storage because all returns can be processed at the warehouse itself.\\nThe customer also has to return only one package, even if the items are from several manufacturers.\\nThe performance of distributor storage with carrier delivery is summarized in Table 4-3.\\nDistributor storage with carrier delivery is well suited for slow- to fast-moving items.\\nTable 4-3 Performance Characteristics of Distributor Storage with Carrier Delivery  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information Service Factor Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Returnability  Higher than manufacturer storage.\\nDifference is not large for faster moving items but can be large for very slow-moving items.\\nLower than manufacturer storage.\\nReduction is highest for faster moving items.\\nSomewhat higher than manufacturer storage.\\nThe difference can be large for very slow-moving items.\\nSimpler infrastructure compared to manufacturer storage.\\nPerformance Faster than manufacturer storage.\\nLower than manufacturer storage.\\nHigher cost to provide the same level of availability as manufacturer storage.\\nBetter than manufacturer storage with drop-shipping.\\nHigher than manufacturer storage.\\nEasier than manufacturer storage.\\nEasier than manufacturer storage.\\nDistributor storage also makes sense when customers want delivery faster than is offered by manufacturer storage but do not need it immediately.\\nDistributor storage can handle somewhat lower variety than manufacturer storage but can handle a much higher level of variety than a chain of retail stores.\\nDistributor Storage with Last-Mile Delivery Last-mile delivery refers to the distributor/retailer delivering the product to the customer\\'s home instead of using a package carrier.\\nWebvan, Peapod, and Albertsons have used last-mile delivery in the grocery industry.\\nAmazon has launched \"local express delivery\" to provide same-day delivery to customers.\\nCompanies such as Kozmo and Urbanfetch tried to set up home-delivery networks for a variety of products but failed to survive.\\nThe automotive spare parts industry is one in which distributor storage with last-mile delivery is the dominant model.\\nIt is too expensive for dealers to carry all spare parts in inventory.\\nThus, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) tend to carry most spare parts at a local distribution center typically located no more than a couple of hours\\' drive from their dealers and often managed by a third party.\\nThe local distribution center is responsible for delivering needed parts to a set of dealers and makes multiple deliveries per day.\\nUnlike package carrier delivery, last-mile delivery requires the distributor warehouse to be much closer to the customer.\\nGiven the limited radius that can be served with last-mile delivery, more warehouses are required compared to when package delivery is used.\\nThe warehouse storage with last-mile delivery network is as shown in Figure 4-9.\\nDistributor storage with last-mile delivery requires higher levels of inventory than the other options (except for retail stores) because it has a lower level of aggregation.\\nFrom an inventory perspective, warehouse storage with last-mile delivery is suitable for relatively fast-moving items that are needed quickly and for which some level of aggregation is beneficial.\\nAuto parts required by car dealers fit this description.\\nAmong all the distribution networks, transportation costs are highest for last-mile delivery, especially when delivering to individuals.\\nThis is because package carriers aggregate delivery across many retailers and are able to obtain better economies of scale than are available to a distributor/retailer attempting last-mile delivery.\\nFactories  Distributor/Retailer Warehouse Customers Product Flow Information Flow .\\n(including transportation and processing) can be more than $20 per home delivery in the grocery industry.\\nLast-mile delivery may be somewhat less expensive in large, dense cities.\\nTransportation costs may also be justifiable for bulky products for which the customer is willing to pay for home delivery.\\nHome delivery of water and large bags of rice has proved quite successful in China, where the high population density has helped decrease delivery costs.\\nTransportation costs of last-mile delivery are best justified in settings where the customer is purchasing in large quantities.\\nThis is rare for individual customers, but businesses such as auto dealerships purchase large quantities of spare parts on a daily basis and can thus justify daily delivery.\\nHome delivery to individual customers can be justified for bulky items such as five-gallon jugs of water in the United States and large bags of rice in China.\\nIn each instance, last-mile delivery is cheaper and more convenient than customers picking up their own bottles or bags.\\nUsing this option, facility costs are somewhat lower than for a network with retail stores but much higher than for either manufacturer storage or distributor storage with package carrier delivery.\\nProcessing costs, however, are much higher than for a network of retail stores because all customer participation is eliminated.\\nA grocery store using last-mile delivery performs all the processing until the product is delivered to the customer\\'s home, unlike a supermarket, where the customer does a lot more work.\\nThe information infrastructure with last-mile delivery is similar to that for distributor storage with package carrier delivery.\\nHowever, it requires the additional capability of scheduling deliveries.\\nResponse times are faster than using package carriers.\\nKozmo and Urbanfetch tried to provide same-day delivery, whereas online grocers typically provide next-day delivery.\\nProduct variety is generally lower than for distributor storage with carrier delivery.\\nThe cost of providing product availability is higher than for every option other than retail stores.\\nThe customer experience can be good using this option, particularly for bulky, hard-to-carry items.\\nTime to market is even higher than for distributor storage with package carrier delivery because the new product has to penetrate deeper before it is available to the customer.\\nOrder visibility is less of an issue given that deliveries are made within 24 hours.\\nThe order-tracking feature does become important to handle exceptions in case of incomplete or undelivered orders.\\nOf all the options discussed, returnability is best with last-mile delivery, because trucks making deliveries can also pick up returns from customers.\\nReturns are still more expensive to handle than at a retail store, where a customer can bring the product back.\\nThe performance characteristics of distributor storage with last-mile delivery are summarized in Table 4-4.\\nIn areas with high labor costs, it is hard to justify last-mile delivery to individual consumers on the basis of efficiency or improved margin.\\nIt can be justified only if there is a large enough customer segment willing to pay for this convenience.\\nIn that case, an effort should be made to couple last-mile delivery with an existing distribution network to exploit economies of scale and improve utilization.\\nAn example is Albertsons\\' use of existing grocery  .\\nTable 4-4 Performance Characteristics of Distributor Storage with Last-Mile Delivery  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information  Higher than distributor storage with package carrier delivery.\\nVery high cost given minimal scale economies.\\nHigher than any other distribution option.\\nFacility costs

distributor storage with package carrier delivery.\\nEasier to implement than other previous options.\\nHarder and more expensive than a retail network.\\nstore facilities and labor to provide home delivery.\\nA portion of the grocery store serves as a fulfillment center for online orders and as a replenishment center for the grocery store itself.\\nThis helps improve utilization and lower the cost of providing this service.\\nLast-mile delivery may be justifiable if customer orders are large enough to provide some economies of scale, and customers are willing to pay for this convenience.\\nPeapod has changed its pricing policies to reflect this idea.\\nMinimum order size is $60 (with a delivery charge of $9.95), and delivery charges drop to $6.95 for orders totaling more than $100.\\nPeapod offers discounts for deliveries during slower periods based on what its schedule looks like.\\nLast-mile delivery is easier to justify when the customer is a business like an auto dealer purchasing large quantities.\\nManufacturer or Distributor Storage with Customer Pickup In this approach, inventory is stored at the manufacturer or distributor warehouse, but customers place their orders online or on the phone and then travel to designated pickup points to collect their merchandise.\\nOrders are shipped from the storage site to the pickup points as needed.\\nExamples include 7dream.com and Otoriyose-bin, operated by Seven-Eleven Japan, which allow customers to pick up online orders at a designated store.\\nA business-to-business (B2B) example is W.W. Grainger, whose customers can pick up their orders at one of the W.W. Grainger retail outlets.\\nSome items are stored at the pickup location, whereas others may come from a central location.\\nIn the case of 7dream.com, the order is delivered from a manufacturer or distributor warehouse to the pickup location.\\nIn 2007, Wal-Mart launched its \"Site to Store\" service that allows customers to order thousands of products online at Walmart.com and have them shipped free to a local Wal-Mart store.\\nItems arrive in stores 7 to 10 business days after the order is processed, and customers receive an e-mail notification when their order is ready for pickup.\\nThe information and product flows shown in Figure 4-10 are similar to those in the Seven-Eleven Japan network.\\nSeven-Eleven has distribution centers where product from  .\\nFactories  Retailer  Cross-Dock DC Pickup Sites  Customers Customer Flow Product Flow Information Flow .\\nmanufacturers is cross-docked and sent to retail outlets on a daily basis.\\nAn online retailer delivering an order through Seven-Eleven can be treated as one of the manufacturers, with deliveries cross-docked and sent to the appropriate Seven-Eleven outlet.\\nServing as an outlet for online orders allows Seven-Eleven to improve utilization of its existing logistical assets.\\nInventory costs using this approach can be kept low, with either manufacturer or distributor storage to exploit aggregation.\\nW.W. Grainger keeps its inventory of fast-moving items at pickup locations, whereas slow-moving items are stocked at a central warehouse or in some cases at the manufacturer.\\nTransportation cost is lower than for any solution using package carriers because significant aggregation is possible when delivering orders to a pickup site.\\nThis allows the use of truckload or less-than-truckload carriers to transport orders to the pickup site.\\nFor a company such as Seven-Eleven Japan, the marginal increase in transportation cost is small because trucks are already making deliveries to the stores, and their utilization can be improved by including online orders.\\nAs a result, Seven-Eleven Japan allows customers to pick up orders without a shipping fee.\\nFacility costs are high if new pickup sites have to be built.\\nA solution using existing sites can lower the additional facility costs.\\nThis, for example, is the case with 7dream.com, Wal-Mart, and W.W. Grainger, for which the stores already exist.\\nProcessing costs at the manufacturer or the warehouse are comparable to those of other solutions.\\nProcessing costs at the pickup site are high because each order must be matched with a specific customer when he or she arrives.\\nCreating this capability can increase processing costs significantly if appropriate storage and information systems are not provided.\\nIncreased processing cost and potential errors at the pickup site are the biggest hurdle to the success of this approach.\\nA significant information infrastructure is needed to provide visibility of the order until the customer picks it up.\\nGood coordination is needed among the retailer, the storage location, and the pickup location.\\nIn this case, a response time comparable to that using package carriers can be achieved.\\nVariety and availability comparable to any manufacturer or distributor storage option can be provided.\\nThere is some loss of customer experience, because unlike the other options discussed, customers must pick up their own orders.\\nOn the other hand, customers who do not want to pay online can pay by cash using this option.\\nIn countries like Japan, where Seven-Eleven has more than 10,000 outlets, it can be argued that the loss of customer convenience is small, because most customers are close to a pickup site and can collect an order at their convenience.\\nIn some cases, this option is considered more convenient because it does  .\\nTable 4-5 Performance Characteristics of Network with Consumer Pickup Sites  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information Service Factor  Can match any other option, depending on the location of inventory.\\nLower than the use of package carriers, especially if using an existing delivery network.\\nFacility costs can be high if new facilities have to be built.\\nCosts are lower if existing facilities are used.\\nThe increase in handling cost at the pickup site can be significant.\\nSignificant investment in infrastructure required Performance  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Returnability  Similar to package carrier delivery with manufacturer or distributor storage.\\nSame-day delivery possible for items stored locally at pickup site.\\nSimilar to other manufacturer or distributor storage options.\\nSimilar to other manufacturer or distributor storage options.\\nLower than other options because of the lack of home delivery.\\nExperience is sensitive to capability of pickup location.\\nSimilar to manufacturer storage options.\\nDifficult but essential.\\nSomewhat easier given that pickup location can handle returns.\\nnot require the customer to be at home at the time of delivery.\\nTime to market for new products can be as short as with manufacturer storage.\\nOrder visibility is extremely important for customer pickups.\\nThe customer must be informed when the order has arrived, and the order should be easily identified once the customer arrives to pick it up.\\nSuch a system is hard to implement because it requires integration of several stages in the supply chain.\\nReturns can potentially be handled at the pickup site, making it easier for customers.\\nFrom a transportation perspective, return flows can be handled using the delivery trucks.\\nThe performance characteristics of manufacturer or distributor storage with consumer pickup sites are summarized in Table 4-5.\\nThe main advantages of a network with consumer pickup sites are that it can lower the delivery cost and expand the set of products sold and customers served online.\\nThe major hurdle is the increased handling cost and complexity at the pickup site.\\nSuch a network is likely to be most effective if existing retail locations are used as pickup sites, because this type of network improves the economies from existing infrastructure.\\nIn particular, such a network can be effective for firms like Seven-Eleven Japan, Wal-Mart, and W.W. Grainger, which have both a network of stores and an online business.\\nUnfortunately, such retail sites are typically designed to allow the customer to do the picking and need to develop the capability of picking a customer-specific order.\\nRetail Storage with Customer Pickup In this option, often viewed as the most traditional type of supply chain, inventory is stored locally at retail stores.\\nCustomers walk into the retail store or place an order online or by phone and pick it up at the retail store.\\nExamples of companies that offer multiple options of order placement include Albertsons, which uses part of the facility as a grocery store and part as an online fulfillment center.\\nCustomers can walk into the store or order online.\\nW.W. Grainger: Customers can order online, by phone, or in person and pick up their order at one of W.W. Grainger\\'s retail outlets.\\nAlbertsons keeps its inventory at the pickup location itself; W.W. Grainger stores some items at the pickup locations, whereas others may come from a central location.\\nLocal storage increases inventory costs because of the lack of aggregation.\\nFor fast- to very fast-moving items, however, there is marginal increase in inventory even with local storage.\\nAlbertsons uses local storage because most of its products are relatively fast moving and are stocked at the supermarket in any case.\\nSimilarly, W.W. Grainger keeps its inventory of fast-moving items at pickup locations, whereas slow-moving items are stocked at a central warehouse.\\nTransportation cost is much lower than with other solutions because inexpensive modes of transport can be used to replenish product at the retail store.\\nFacility costs are high because many local facilities are required.\\nA minimal information infrastructure is needed if customers walk into the store and place orders.\\nFor online orders, however, a significant information infrastructure is needed to provide visibility of the order until the customer picks it up.\\nGood response times can be achieved with this system because of local storage.\\nFor example, both Albertsons and W.W. Grainger offer same-day pickup from their retail locations.\\nProduct variety stored locally is lower than under other options.\\nIt is more expensive than with all other options to provide a high level of product availability.\\nCustomer experience depends on whether or not the customer likes to shop.\\nTime to market is the highest with this option because the new product has to penetrate through the entire supply chain before it is available to customers.\\nOrder visibility is extremely important for customer pickups when orders are placed online or by phone.\\nReturns can be handled at the pickup site.\\nOverall, returnability is fairly good using this option.\\nThe performance characteristics of a network with customer pickup sites and local retail storage are summarized in Table 4-6.\\nThe main advantage of a network with retail storage is that it can lower delivery costs and provide a faster response than other networks.\\nThe major disadvantage is the increased inventory and facility costs.\\nSuch a network is best suited for fast-moving items or items for which customers value rapid response.\\nTable 4-6 Performance Characteristics of Retail Storage at Consumer Pickup Sites  Cost Factor  Performance  Inventory Transportation Facilities and handling Information  Higher than all other options.\\nLower than all other options.\\nHigher than other options.\\nThe increase in handling cost at the pickup site can be significant for online and phone orders.\\nSome investment in infrastructure required for online and phone orders.\\nService Factor  Performance  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Returnability  Same-day (immediate) pickup possible for items stored locally at pickup site.\\nLower than all other options.\\nMore expensive to provide than all other options.\\nRelated to whether shopping is viewed as a positive or negative experience by customer.\\nHighest among distribution options.\\nTrivial for in-store orders.\\nDifficult, but essential, for online and phone orders.\\nEasier than other options because retail store can provide a substitute.\\nSelecting a Distribution Network Design A network designer needs to consider product characteristics as well as network requirements when deciding on the appropriate delivery network.\\nThe various networks considered earlier have different strengths and weaknesses.\\nIn Table 4-7, the various delivery networks are ranked relative to one another along different performance dimensions.\\nA ranking of 1 indicates the best performance along a given dimension; as the relative performance worsens, the ranking number increases.\\nOnly niche companies end up using a single distribution network.\\nMost companies are best served by a combination of delivery networks.\\nThe combination used depends on product characteristics and the strategic position that the firm is targeting.\\nThe suitability of different delivery designs (from a supply chain perspective) in various situations is shown in Table 4-8.\\nAn excellent example of a hybrid network is that of W.W. Grainger, which combines all the aforementioned options in its distribution network.\\nThe network, however, is tailored to match the characteristics of the product and the needs of the customer.\\nFast-moving and emergency items are stocked locally, and customers can either pick them up or have them shipped, depending on the urgency.\\nSlower moving items are stocked at a national DC and shipped to the customer within a day or two.\\nVery slow-moving items are typically drop-shipped from the manufacturer and carry a longer lead time.\\nAnother hybrid network is used by Amazon, which stocks fast-moving items at most of its warehouses, slower moving items at fewer warehouses, and very slow-moving items may be drop-shipped from distributors or publishers.\\nWe can now revisit the examples from the computer industry discussed at the beginning of the chapter.\\nGateway\\'s decision to create a network of retail stores without exploiting any of the supply chain advantages such a network offers was flawed.\\nTo fully exploit the benefits of the retail network, Gateway should have stocked its standard configurations (likely to have high demand) at the retail stores, with all other configurations drop-shipped from the factory (perhaps with local pickup at the retail stores if that was economical).\\nInstead, it drop-shipped all configurations from the factory.\\nApple has opened several retail stores and actually carries products for sale at these stores.\\nThis makes sense given the low variety and high demand for Apple products.\\nIn fact, Apple has seen consistent growth in sales and profits through its retail outlets.\\nTable 4-7 Comparative Performance of Delivery Network Designs  Retail Storage with Customer Pickup  Manufacturer Storage with Direct Shipping  Manufacturer Storage with In-Transit Merge  Distributor Storage with Package Carrier Delivery  Distributor Storage with Last-Mile Delivery  Manufacturer Storage with Pickup  Response time  1  4  4  3  2  4  Product variety  4  1  1  2  3  1  Product availability  4  1  1  2  3  1  Customer  Varies from  4  3  2  1  5  experience  1 to 5  Time to market  4  1  1  2  3  1  Order visibility  1  5  4  3  2  6  Returnability  15  5  4  3  2  Inventory  41 1 2 3 1  Transportation  1  4  3  2  5  1  Facility and handling  6  1  2  3  4  5  Information 1 4 4 3 2 5  Key: 1 corresponds to the strongest performance and 6 the weakest performance.\\nTable 4-8 Performance of Delivery Networks for Different Product/Customer Characteristics  Retail Storage with Customer Pickup  Manufacturer Storage with Direct Shipping  Manufacturer Storage with In-Transit Merge  Distributor Storage with Package Carrier Delivery  Distributor Storage with Last-Mile Delivery  Manufacturer Storage with Pickup  High-demand product Medium-demand product Low-demand product Very low-demand product Many product sources High product value Quick desired response High product variety Low customer effort  +2 +1 -1 -2 +1 -1 +2 -1 -2  -2 -1 +1 +2 -1 +2 -2 +2 +1  -1 0 0 +1 -1 +1 -2 0 +2  0 +1 -1 +1 0 0  +1 -1 +1 0 -2 +1  +2 +1  0  +1 0 +2  -1 +1 -2  +1 0 +2  +2 +2 -1  Key: +2 = very suitable; +1 = somewhat suitable; 0 = neutral; -1 = somewhat unsuitable; -2 = very unsuitable.\\nIn this section, we use ideas discussed earlier in the chapter to see how the Internet has affected the structure and performance of various distribution networks.\\nThe goal is to understand what drove the successful introduction of online sales in some networks and not others, and how these networks are likely to evolve.\\nSimilar to our consideration with distribution networks, we build a scorecard based on how online sales affect a supply chain\\'s ability to meet customer needs and the cost of meeting those needs.\\nWe now detail the contents of each scorecard category.\\nImpact of Online Sales on Customer Service As with distribution networks considered earlier, we start by studying how online sales affect customer service elements such as response time, product variety, availability, customer experience, time to market, visibility, and returnability.\\nWe also look at factors such as direct sales and the ability to offer flexible pricing that help companies selling online.\\nRESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMERS When selling physical products that cannot be downloaded, online sales take longer to fulfill a customer request than does a retail store because of the shipping time involved.\\nThus, customers who require a short response time may not use the Internet to order a product.\\nThere is no such delay, however, for information goods.\\nThe Internet has facilitated almost instantaneous access to movies, music, and books in digital form.\\nPRODUCT VARIETY A company selling online finds it easier to offer a larger selection of products than a bricks-and-mortar store.\\nFor example, Netflix offers a much larger selection of movies than any video rental store.\\nOffering the same selection at a store would require a huge location with a correspondingly large amount of inventory.\\nPRODUCT AVAILABILITY By aggregating its inventory, a company selling online improves product availability.\\nBetter information on customer preferences also allows firms selling online to improve availability.\\nCUSTOMER EXPERIENCE Online sales affect customer experience in terms of access, customization, and convenience.\\nUnlike most retail stores that are open only during business hours, the Internet allows a customer to place an order at any convenient time.\\nIn fact, W.W. Grainger has observed a surge in online orders after their bricks-and-mortar stores close.\\nOnline sales also allow a firm to access customers who are geographically distant.\\nUsing the Internet, a small specialty retail store located near Chicago can reach customers all over the United States, or even the world.\\nAccess to online sales is limited only by the customers\\' access to the Internet.\\nThe Internet offers an opportunity to create a personalized buying experience for each customer.\\nFor example, Amazon displays products that are related to what customers have recently purchased or browsed.\\nFirms that focus on mass customization can use the Internet to help customers select a product that suits their needs.\\nFor example, Dell allows customers to customize their computers by using the options available on the Dell Web site.\\nFor both consumers and companies, online sales can increase the ease with which one does business.\\nCustomers do not have to leave home or work to make a purchase.\\nFor many companies selling online, such as Peapod, information from past purchases is used to significantly speed up order placement for the customer.\\nFASTER TIME TO MARKET A firm can introduce a new product much more quickly online as compared to physical channels.\\nA firm that sells PCs through physical channels must produce enough units to stock the shelves at its distributors and retailers before it starts to see revenue from the new product.\\nA firm selling online, in contrast, makes a new product available online as soon as the first unit is ready to be produced.\\nThis is evident at Walmart.com, where larger new TVs go on sale well before they are sold at Wal-Mart stores.\\nORDER VISIBILITY The Internet makes it possible to provide visibility of order status.\\nFrom a customer\\'s perspective, it is crucial to provide this visibility because an online order has no physical equivalent to a customer shopping for an item at a retail store.\\nRETURNABILITY Returnability is harder with online orders, which typically arrive from a centralized location.\\nIt is much easier to return a product purchased at a retail store.\\nThe proportion of returns is also likely to be much higher for online orders because customers are unable to touch and feel the product before their purchase.\\nGoing online thus increases the cost of reverse flows.\\nDIRECT SALES TO CUSTOMERS The Internet allows manufacturers and other members of the supply chain that do not have direct contact with customers in traditional channels to get customer feedback and build a relationship with the customer.\\nSocial networking channels such as Facebook and Twitter allow firms to directly pitch products and promotions to customers.\\nFLEXIBLE PRICING, PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, AND PROMOTIONS Given the ease of changing prices and assortments online, the Internet allows a company selling online to manage revenues from its available product portfolio much more effectively than do traditional channels.\\nPromotion information can be conveyed to customers quickly and inexpensively using the Internet as long as the business has access to its customer network.\\nGroupon is a company that has used social networking online to push promotions to customers.\\nEFFICIENT FUNDS TRANSFER The Internet and cell phones can enhance the convenience and lower the cost of revenue collection, especially in small amounts.\\nFor example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Mercy Corps transferred $40 automatically into each Haitian person\\'s account allowing him or her to buy food at local merchants.\\nThis was much more efficient than handing out cash or vouchers.\\nImpact of Online Sales on Cost On the cost side, online sales affect inventory, facilities, transportation, and information costs.\\nIt is important to observe that the impact in each case is not necessarily positive.\\nINVENTORY Online sales can lower inventory levels by aggregating inventories far from customers if most customers are willing to wait for delivery.\\nFor example, Amazon is able to aggregate its inventory of books at a few warehouses.\\nBarnes & Noble, in contrast, needs more inventory because it must carry a significant portion of its stock at retail stores.\\nA key point to note is that the relative benefit of aggregation is small for high-demand items with low variability but large for low-demand items with high variability.\\nOnline sales can lower a firm\\'s inventories if it can postpone the introduction of variety until after the customer order is received.\\nThe time lag between when a customer places the order and when he or she expects delivery offers a company selling online a window of opportunity to implement postponement.\\nFor example, for its online business, Dell keeps its inventory as components and assembles its PCs after receiving the customer order.\\nThe amount of component inventory required is much lower than it would be if Dell kept its inventories in the form of assembled PCs.\\nSimilarly, Amazon prints some low-volume books to order, allowing it to reduce inventories.\\nFACILITIES Two basic types of facilities costs must be included in the analysis: (1) costs related to the number and location of facilities in a network and (2) costs associated with the operations that take place in these facilities.\\nA company selling online can reduce network facility costs by centralizing operations, thereby decreasing the number of facilities required.\\nFor example, Netflix is able to satisfy demand for DVD rentals from about 50 warehouses, whereas Blockbuster needed thousands of retail outlets to serve customers.\\nWith regard to ongoing operating costs, customer participation in selection and order placement allows a company selling online to lower its resource costs relative to staffing a call center.\\nOnline sales can also lower a firm\\'s order fulfillment costs because it does not have to fill an order as soon as it arrives.\\nA retail store or supermarket must staff its sales counters so that more cashiers are available when more customers are shopping.\\nAs a result, these stores require greater staffing during peak periods.\\nWith online sales, if a reasonable buffer of unfilled orders is maintained, the rate of order fulfillment can be made significantly smoother than the rate at which orders arrive, which reduces the peak load for order fulfillment and thus reduces resource requirements and cost.\\nOn the downside, however, for some products, such as groceries, online sales require the firm to perform tasks currently performed by the customer at retail stores, affecting both handling and transportation costs.\\nIn such situations, companies selling online will incur higher handling and delivery costs than a retail store.\\nFor example, whereas a customer picks out the required items at a grocery store, an online seller such as Peapod incurs higher handling costs because its employees must pick a customer\\'s order from the warehouse shelves and deliver it to the customer\\'s home.\\nTRANSPORTATION The Internet has significantly lowered the cost of \"transporting\" information goods in digital form such as movies, music, and books.\\nFor nondigital products, aggregating inventories increases outbound transportation relative to inbound transportation.\\nCompared to a business with many retail outlets, an online seller with aggregated inventories tends to have higher transportation costs (across the entire supply chain) per unit because of the increased outbound costs.\\nINFORMATION An online seller can share demand information throughout its supply chain to improve visibility.\\nThe Internet may also be used to share planning and forecasting information within the supply chain, further improving coordination.\\nThis helps reduce overall supply chain costs and better match supply and demand.\\nHere we see that information is an enabler of many of the benefits of online sales discussed so far.\\nA company selling online incurs additional information costs, however, to build and maintain the information infrastructure.\\nFor example, when Amazon purchased Zappos, it had to add about 120,000 product descriptions and more than 2 million photographs to its Web site.\\nTable 4-9 The Online Sales Scorecard  Area  Impact  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Direct sales Flexible pricing, portfolio, promotions Efficient funds transfer Inventory Facilities Transportation Information  Key: +2 = very positive; +1 = positive; 0 = neutral; -1 = negative; -2 = very negative.\\nThe blank B2C online sales scorecard shown in Table 4-9 can be used by a firm to summarize the impact of online sales on each of the areas identified earlier.\\nThe value of setting up online sales is not the same in every industry.\\nWhereas Amazon and Blue Nile have seen their profits increase after going online, Webvan and many other online grocers have gone out of business.\\nThe scorecard in Table 4-9 can be used to understand how online sales affect the performance of different supply chain networks.\\nIn the next section, we apply the online sales scorecard to several examples.\\nUsing Online Sales to Sell Computer Hardware: Dell The online channel has proved very effective for the sale of computer hardware and by 2009 represented about half the sales in this category.\\nAfter more than a decade of tremendous success selling its PCs only online, Dell started to sell PCs through retail stores such as Wal-Mart in 2007.\\nSince about 2005, Apple has had considerable success selling its phones and computers through retail stores.\\nThis raises the question of the relative value of the online channel and retail stores for selling computer hardware.\\nTo make this comparison, we compare Dell\\'s supply chain for each channel.\\nAs shown in Figure 4-11, when using the online channel, Dell typically starts assembly after receiving a  Customer Dell  Customer Pull Retail Store  Pull  Dell  Supplier  Supplier  Dell\\'s Online Supply Chain Dell\\'s Retail Supply Chain  .\\ncustomer order (shown by the fact that Dell is above the push/pull boundary).\\nFor the retail channel, in contrast, Dell assembles the PC in the push phase of the supply chain often well in advance of the final sale.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR COMPUTER HARDWARE The main disadvantage for Dell of selling hardware over the Internet is the delay in fulfilling the customer request.\\nWhereas a longer response time is not a big negative for high-value, customized hardware, it is a disadvantage for Dell when trying to sell its low-cost standardized configurations online.\\nDell is able to exploit most of the responsiveness-enhancing opportunities offered by the Internet for customized hardware.\\nThe company uses the Internet to offer a wide variety of customized PC configurations with the desired processor, memory, hard drive, and other components.\\nCustomization allows Dell to satisfy customers by giving them a product that is close to their specific requirements.\\nThe customization options are easy to display over the Internet, allowing Dell to attract customers who value this choice.\\nDell also uses customized Web pages to enable large business customers to place orders.\\nClearly, all these capabilities are not as valuable for standardized configurations.\\nThe Internet allows companies like Dell and Apple to bring new products to market quickly.\\nThis is particularly important in the computer and cell phone industry wherein products have short life cycles of a few months.\\nWhereas the Internet allows a new product to be offered as soon as it is produced, the retail channel requires the entire supply chain to be stocked before customers can access the product.\\nThe Internet channel has allowed companies like Dell to make price changes quickly and efficiently based on product availability and demand.\\nBy being available all day, the online channel allows Dell to serve customers at a much lower cost than retail stores.\\nSelling online allows Dell to collect payment for its hardware in a matter of days after it is sold.\\nDell, however, pays its suppliers according to the more traditional schedules in which payment is due in weeks (e.g., 30 days).\\nGiven its low levels of inventory, Dell is able to operate its business with negative working capital because it receives payment for its hardware about 44 days before it pays its suppliers for their components.\\nA hardware supply chain including distributors and retailers cannot achieve these results.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON COST IN THE PC INDUSTRY Inventory Costs.\\nIts online sales offer Dell the ability to reduce its inventories by aggregating them in a few geographic locations, whereas a chain of retail stores selling computers must carry inventory in each store.\\nDell is able to further reduce inventories by exploiting the time that elapses from the point at which an online order arrives to the point at which it must be shipped.\\nDell products and assembly lines are designed so that all components on which customers are offered customization can be assembled in a short period of time.\\nThis allows Dell to hold component inventories and postpone assembly until after the customer order has been placed.\\nPostponement and component commonality allow Dell to reduce inventories significantly.\\nObserve that inventory reduction through aggregation and postponement is much more significant for high-value, customized configurations with low and unpredictable demand compared to low-value, standardized configurations with large and predictable demand.\\nThe online channel allows the Dell supply chain to lower facility costs relative to the retail channel because Dell incurs only the cost of the manufacturing facility and warehousing space for components.\\nA brick-and-mortar retail chain must pay for the distribution warehouses and retail stores as well.\\nDell is also able to take advantage of customer participation and save on the cost of call center representatives because customers do all the work when they place an order online.\\nTransportation Costs.\\nAs a result of online sales, total transportation costs in the Dell supply chain are higher than in a supply chain selling hardware through distributors and retailers.\\nDell sends individual PCs to customers from its factories, whereas a manufacturer selling through distributors and retailers sends large shipments on trucks to warehouses and to retailers.\\nThe Dell supply chain thus has higher outbound transportation costs.\\nThe higher transportation costs for the centralized Dell supply chain are a larger fraction of cost for low-cost, standardized configurations than for high-cost, customized ones.\\nAlthough Dell has made a significant investment in information technology (IT) to implement its build-to-order model, the majority of these IT costs would be incurred regardless of Dell\\'s online sales status.\\nTherefore, online sales do add incrementally to Dell\\'s information costs, but this is not a significant factor given the benefits.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON PERFORMANCE AT DELL As summarized in the online sales scorecard in Table 4-10, online sales allow Dell to significantly improve its performance for high-value, customized hardware in terms of both responsiveness and cost.\\nFor low-cost, standardized hardware, however, the online channel is significantly less attractive because its main strength, inventory reduction through aggregation, is not as valuable for low-cost, standardized configurations.\\nSimultaneously, the weaknesses of the online channel--poorer responsiveness and higher transportation costs--become more significant for low-cost, standardized configurations.\\nA TAILORED SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK FOR HARDWARE USING RETAIL STORES AND THE INTERNET It may seem at first glance that selling hardware online has significant advantages.\\nA careful study, however, indicates that a hybrid model combining retail stores and the online channel can be very effective.\\nThis issue becomes more significant as hardware becomes more of a commodity.\\nThe online channel is most effective to sell new products or customized hardware configurations whose demand is hard to forecast with the retail channel selling low-cost, standard configurations whose demand is easier to forecast.\\nManufacturers should introduce new models on the Internet; as demand for some of them grows, these models should be added to the retail channel.\\nAnother option is to introduce recommended configurations of new models at  Table 4-10 Impact of Online Sales on Performance at Dell  Area  Impact for Customized Impact for Standard  Hardware  Low-Cost Hardware  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to market Order visibility Direct sales Flexible pricing, portfolio, promotions Efficient funds

production and satisfying that demand online.\\nThese models should be built to order using as many common components as is feasible.\\nThe standard models can be produced using a low-cost approach even if it involves longer lead time.\\nSelling standardized models through distributors and retail stores allows the supply chain to save on transportation costs, which are are a higher fraction of cost for these low-cost configurations.\\nRetailers can be allowed to participate in online sales by having kiosks where customers can configure models of their choice or order standardized models that are out of stock.\\nA hardware manufacturer can use the tailored approach outlined earlier to take advantage of the strengths of both online sales and traditional retail and distribution channels.\\nGateway failed in its effort with retail stores because it did not use any of the supply chain strengths of the bricks-and-mortar channel.\\nInstead of just helping people with configuration at its retail stores, Gateway would have served its customers better by also carrying recommended configurations of its PCs in the stores.\\nThis would immediately satisfy customers who wanted the recommended configuration, while allowing Gateway to produce the more customized configurations efficiently.\\nIn contrast, Apple has been very successful with its retail channel because it sells a relatively low variety of standardized hardware in large volumes at its stores.\\nDell has also started using the tailored approach with high-value customized hardware such as servers built to order while lowvalue standardized hardware is produced in low cost countries and sold through retail stores such as Wal-Mart.\\nIn the long run, a tailored approach is likely to prevail in the computer hardware and cell phone industry.\\nUsing Online Sales to Sell Books: Amazon Book supply chains have been transformed with the advent of online sales and the launching of Amazon.com in July 1995.\\nSince then, Amazon has added many categories to its product offerings, including music, toys, electronics, software, and home improvement equipment.\\nWhereas the Internet provided some advantage to Amazon for the sale of physical books, this advantage has magnified with the growth in electronic books (e-books).\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE BOOK INDUSTRY Online sales have not helped profits for traditional books to the same extent as in the customized PC industry.\\nUnlike the PC industry, in which online sales facilitate direct sales by manufacturers, the Internet has not shortened supply chains in the book industry.\\nFor traditional books, Amazon can attract only customers who are willing to wait a few days to get a book.\\nAmazon also cannot attract customers who value the ability to leaf through books.\\nThe company tries to counter this problem by providing reviews and other information on books to allow customers to get a feel for the book online.\\nTo counter these drawbacks, Amazon has exploited several opportunities on the Internet to attract customers and increase revenues.\\nAmazon attracts many customers by offering a selection of millions of books.\\nCustomers can search for hard-to-find books or those of special interest.\\nA large physical bookstore, in contrast, can carry fewer than a hundred thousand titles.\\nAmazon also uses the Internet to recommend books to customers based on their purchase history.\\nCustomers are sent e-mails informing them of new titles that match their interests.\\nAmazon also provides reviews and comments from other customers on the titles available.\\nNew titles are quickly introduced and made available online, whereas in a bricks-and-mortar bookstore chain, all retail stores have to be stocked.\\nAmazon uses the Internet to allow customers to order a book at any time from the comfort of their own home.\\nIf customers know the books they want, they can place the order online and the books will be delivered to their door.\\nThere is no need to leave the house and spend an hour or two going to a physical bookstore.\\nThis fact allows Amazon to attract customers who value this convenience and are willing to wait for delivery.\\nFor e-books, Amazon is able to gain greater advantage using the online channel.\\nFor example, customers can download a book in seconds without having to leave home.\\nFor people who value time, this experience is superior to buying a traditional book either online or at a bookstore.\\nProduct availability is never an issue with e-books, and variety can be added at low marginal cost.\\nIn fact, the Internet has allowed the availability of books that are not guaranteed a high enough demand to make them viable for traditional publishers.\\nFor very low-volume books, there is no better channel than online as e-books.\\nCOST IMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON THE BOOK INDUSTRY Amazon also uses online sales to lower its inventory and some of its facility costs.\\nFor traditional books, transportation costs increase as a result of selling books online.\\nFor e-books, however, transportation cost is not a factor given that they can be downloaded efficiently on the Internet.\\nAmazon is able to decrease inventories by aggregating physical inventories in a few geographical locations.\\nA bookstore chain, in contrast, has higher inventories because titles are carried at every store.\\nThe reduction of inventories from aggregation is most significant for low-demand books with high demand uncertainty.\\nThe benefit is less significant for best sellers with demand that is more predictable.\\nAmazon carries medium- to high-demand titles in inventory, whereas it purchases low-demand titles from publishers in response to a customer order.\\nIn some instances, Amazon also prints very low-volume titles with print-on-demand technology.\\nThis allows the Amazon supply chain to further reduce inventories of low-demand titles.\\nFor e-books, Amazon incurs no inventory costs because they do not have to be stored physically.\\nIts online sales allow Amazon to lower facility costs because it does not need the retail infrastructure that a bookstore chain such as Barnes & Noble must have.\\nInitially, Amazon did not have a warehouse, purchasing all books from distributors.\\nWhen demand volumes were low, the distributor was a better location to carry inventories because it aggregated demand across other booksellers besides Amazon.\\nAs demand has grown, however, Amazon has opened its own warehouses, where it stocks books.\\nThus, facility costs at Amazon are growing, although they are still much lower than the facility costs for a bookstore chain.\\nFor e-books, Amazon needs server capacity to ensure that downloads are quick, but the investment in server capacity is likely to be cheaper than the warehousing required to serve physical demand.\\nTransportation Costs.\\nThe Amazon supply chain incurs higher transportation costs than a bookstore chain selling through retail stores.\\nLocal bookstores do not have the cost of individually shipping books to customers.\\nAmazon, in contrast, incurs the cost of shipping books to its customers from warehouses.\\nThe shipping cost from an Amazon warehouse represents a significant fraction of the cost of a book (it can be even higher than 100 percent for an inexpensive book).\\nAs demand has grown, Amazon has opened several warehouses in an effort to get closer to customers, decrease its transportation costs, and improve response time.\\nTransportation costs at Amazon in 2009 were more than $1.77 billion; after accounting for transportation revenue, the net loss on outbound transportation was $849 million, a very significant amount.\\nIn contrast, the cost of delivering e-books and other digital content to customers is negligible in comparison.\\nAs with Dell, setting up online sales takes some additional investment in IT, but this is not incrementally significant compared with the IT that is required to run a bricksand-mortar business.\\nTherefore, IT costs for online sales are somewhat higher, but not prohibitively so.\\nThe cost of IT infrastructure to support download of e-books, however, is more expensive.\\nImpact of Online Sales on Performance at Amazon.\\nAmazon\\'s online sales scorecard is summarized in Table 4-11.\\nA comparison of Tables 4-10 and 4-11 shows that online sales offer far greater advantages when selling computer hardware than when selling physical books.\\nSome key differences between the two products are that (1) product differentiation in hardware can be  .\\nTable 4-11 Impact of Online Sales on Performance at Amazon  Area  Physical books  e-books  Response

portion of the cost of books and a relatively small portion of the cost of PCs.\\nFor e-books, however, the Internet offers tremendous advantage relative to traditional bookstores.\\nAmazon has pushed hard after the release of the Kindle, its e-reader, to encourage customers to buy books online.\\nOther digital content that Amazon sells includes movies, software, and music.\\nIn each instance, the Internet channel offers tremendous advantage relative to physical distribution.\\nWith the growth of iTunes at Apple and online sales at Amazon, retail chains built on selling physical formats of music had a difficult time surviving, with most closing by 2010.\\nIn the movie business, large DVD retailers like Wal-Mart have continued to do well, but smaller retail formats such as Blockbuster have not survived selling and renting physical DVDs.\\nA SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK FOR BOOKS USING RETAIL STORES AND THE INTERNET In the 1980s, large bookstore chains such as Borders and Barnes & Noble established themselves at the expense of mom-and-pop bookstores primarily through aggregation.\\nLarge retail footprints allowed the two chains to carry a greater variety of books while often achieving lower costs than the small bookstores.\\nBoth Borders and Barnes & Noble charged full price for low-demand books, while they provided a greater variety and offered a discount on best sellers.\\nSuch an approach was effective until Amazon established a dominant position.\\nAmazon uses the Internet to sell low-volume books much more efficiently than either bookstore chain.\\nWith the growth in e-books and other retail formats such as Wal-Mart and Costco selling best sellers, the large bookstore chains are stuck in the middle without any area of dominance.\\nLarge bookstore chains are in danger of being squeezed from both ends: other retail formats for best-selling books and online sales for other low-volume books and e-books.\\nBorders was shut down and liquidated in 2011 and Barnes & Noble was facing significant challenges.\\nUsing the Internet to Sell Groceries: Peapod The grocery industry saw a spurt in new online sellers in 1998 and l999, although virtually all have gone out of business.\\nPeapod, one of the oldest online grocers, is one of the few left.\\nthis industry\\'s poor track record, one might surmise that this is an industry not well suited for online sales.\\nDespite the lack of success in this industry, Amazon jumped into it in 2010 starting with a pilot in Seattle.\\nLet us take a look with our scorecard to see where, if at all, the Internet offers an advantage in this industry.\\nPeapod started by supplying orders using employees at grocery stores to pick and deliver orders.\\nThe company has now moved to supplying orders from centralized fulfillment centers in Chicago and Washington, D.C., and from large supermarkets with adjacent \"warerooms\" in other areas.\\nEach fulfillment center is much larger than a supermarket and is comparable to a warehouse.\\nThe Peapod and supermarket supply chains are comparable except that for a supermarket, some products come from a warehouse whereas the rest come directly from suppliers.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE GROCERY INDUSTRY Peapod and other online groceries have tried to sell convenience and the time savings they offer customers.\\nFor many people, grocery shopping is a chore that is time consuming and rarely enjoyable.\\nPeapod allows customers to place orders at any time and have them delivered at home, eliminating a trip to the supermarket.\\nThis can be a significant convenience, especially in urban areas, where customers have to walk to a supermarket and carry all their groceries home.\\nIn a suburban area, the benefit is smaller because people tend to batch their shopping and can drive to supermarkets with relative ease.\\nThe convenience of saving time, however, remains quite valuable.\\nThe convenience factor related to access is even more significant if a specialty-food provider goes online.\\nSpecialty and ethnic food stores are not as accessible as supermarkets, and people often drive long distances to reach them.\\nOffering these foods on the Internet provides easy access to customers and saves a long drive.\\nPeapod, however, offers less variety than a typical supermarket.\\nMost large supermarkets offer sufficiently large variety to cover the needs of most households.\\nPeapod is able to increase revenues by creating a personalized shopping experience for customers and delivering customized, one-to-one advertising and promotions.\\nThis is done using extensive member profiles that Peapod creates based on online shopping behavior, purchase histories, and surveys.\\nUnlike a supermarket, in which the store does not know what customers have selected until they check out, Peapod can guide online customers based on what they purchase.\\nFor example, if a customer buys some pasta, Peapod can suggest a type of pasta sauce or some Parmesan cheese.\\nOver longer periods, Peapod can collect shopping patterns and suggest products that match a customer\\'s preferences.\\nSuch suggestions enhance revenues by increasing customers\\' impulse purchases.\\nPeapod also adds to its revenues by giving consumer goods companies a forum for targeted interactive advertising and electronic coupons.\\nPeapod increases revenues by selling data on consumer choices to product manufacturers.\\nConsumer choice data available to an online grocer is more valuable than scanner data from a supermarket because scanner data reveals only the customer\\'s final purchases.\\nAn online grocer, in contrast, can record the customer\\'s decision process by, for example, recording a customer\\'s substitution patterns for items that are out of stock.\\nWith scanner data, a supermarket cannot record substitutions because it has no way of finding out if the customer looked for something that is out of stock.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON COSTS IN THE GROCERY INDUSTRY Peapod and other online grocers use online sales to lower some facility costs and, to an extent, inventory costs.\\nPicking costs and transportation costs, however, are much higher than for traditional supermarkets.\\nCompared to a supermarket chain, an online grocer such as Peapod can lower inventories by aggregating the inventory in a few large replenishment centers.\\nThe degree of aggregation, however, is less than that achieved by Amazon for books or Dell for hardware, because Peapod needs fulfillment centers in every urban area it serves to get food to customers in acceptable condition.\\nThe benefits of aggregation are further diminished by the fact that the majority of products sold at a supermarket are staple items with steady demand.\\nThus, aggregation provides a marginal benefit in terms of improved forecast accuracy and reduced inventories (see Chapter 12).\\nThe benefits of aggregation are higher for specialty, low-demand items with high demand uncertainty.\\nThese products constitute a small fraction of overall sales at a supermarket.\\nThus, aggregation allows e-grocers to lower their inventory costs only marginally compared to a typical supermarket.\\nIf online grocers focused primarily on specialty items such as ethnic foods, the inventory benefits of aggregation would be larger.\\nPeapod\\'s online sales allow it to lower facility costs because it needs only warehouse facilities and can save on the cost of retail outlets such as supermarkets.\\nProcessing costs at Peapod to fulfill an order, however, are significantly higher than those for a supermarket and overwhelm the savings from needing fewer facilities.\\nPeapod saves on checkout clerks compared to a supermarket but must pick the customer order, a task the customer performs at a supermarket and one that is much more time consuming than checkout.\\nThus, online sales result in a loss of customer participation compared to a supermarket and raise overall facility costs.\\nAn online grocer such as Peapod has significantly higher transportation costs than a supermarket.\\nSupermarkets have the advantage of having to bear only inbound transportation cost for products, with customers providing transportation from the supermarket to their homes.\\nInbound transportation costs tend to be low because supermarkets have large deliveries that enable them to exploit economies of scale in transportation.\\nPeapod, in contrast, has to bear inbound transportation cost to its fulfillment centers and then outbound delivery costs from the fulfillment centers to customer homes.\\nOutbound delivery costs are high, because individual orders must be delivered to each customer\\'s home.\\nThe task becomes all the more problematic given the different temperature requirements for different types of food.\\nCompared to computers and even books, groceries have a low value-to-weight/volume ratio.\\nFor example, paper towels and bathroom tissues have very low value but occupy a lot of space in a truck.\\nThus, transportation costs are a significant fraction of the cost incurred by online grocers.\\nThis makes it difficult for an online grocer to compete with a supermarket on prices.\\nAgain, the IT infrastructure required for online sales increases costs.\\nIn the case of an online grocer, this is somewhat more significant than with the other online channels we have been discussing, because an online grocer takes on a wider range of functions that shoppers do themselves.\\nTherefore, IT costs are higher for an online grocer.\\nAs in the other examples, however, IT costs are not a deal breaker for this business model.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON PERFORMANCE AT PEAPOD Online sales offer some revenue-enhancement opportunities in the grocery industry.\\nCosts, however, are significantly higher for an online grocer than for a supermarket, as we can see from Table 4-12.\\nA comparison of Tables 4-10, 4-11, and 4-12 shows that online sales offer fewer benefits when selling groceries compared to books and computer hardware.\\nSupermarkets are large enough to enjoy most of the inventory benefits that aggregation offers, without having the additional delivery cost incurred by an online grocer.\\nOnline grocers cannot compete with supermarkets on price and can succeed only if there are enough people willing to pay a premium for the convenience of home delivery.\\nOnline grocers, however, can provide some cost advantage when selling specialty groceries, whose demand tends to be low and uncertain.\\nVALUE OF ONLINE SALES TO A TRADITIONAL GROCERY CHAIN Traditional supermarket chains can benefit by using the online channel to complement the strengths of their existing network.\\nThe online channel can be used to offer convenience to customers who are willing to pay for it.\\nSupermarkets can be used to target customers who value lower prices.\\nTable 4-12 Impact of Online Sales on Performance at Peapod Area  Impact  Response time Product variety Product availability Customer experience Time to

positive; +1 = positive; 0 = neutral; -1 = negative; -2 = very negative.\\nA supermarket chain with online sales has the opportunity to offer an entire array of services at differing prices based on the amount of work the customer does.\\nThe cheapest service involves customers walking into the supermarket and shopping for the products they want.\\nIn this case, the customer picks the order from the shelves and provides outbound transportation for it.\\nFor an additional charge, a supermarket might allow customers to place orders online to be picked up at a later time.\\nThe supermarket personnel would pick the order from the shelves, but the customer would provide outbound transportation.\\nThe most expensive service is when the customer places orders online for home delivery.\\nIn this case, the supermarket chain is responsible for both picking the order from the shelves and delivering it to the customer\\'s home.\\nThe varying services and prices would allow supermarket chains to efficiently satisfy the needs of a variety of customers.\\nAmong the supermarket chains, Albertsons has taken the lead in combining online sales with physical supermarkets.\\nIt has renamed some of its stores Albertsons.com.\\nHalf the store remains a traditional supermarket, while the other half is used to fulfill online grocery orders.\\nThis allows the firm to exploit economies of scale on inbound transportation while keeping delivery distances to customers short on the outbound side.\\nCustomers are allowed to pick up their orders at the store or have the order delivered to their home.\\nBased on our analysis, the Albertsons model is likely to be the most effective method for combining online sales with existing supermarkets in the grocery industry, whereas pure online grocers are likely to be less effective.\\nAs we have mentioned earlier, the online channel is also more effective for specialty grocers.\\nIn fact, Amazon has set up a specialty grocery area on its Web site to go after this market.\\nAmazon has also entered the home delivery grocery market, but it remains to be seen how successful it will be.\\nUsing the Internet to Rent Movies: Netflix Founded in 1997, Netflix had grown to more than 20 million subscribers by 2011 and was the world\\'s largest subscription service sending DVDs by mail and streaming movies and television episodes over the Internet.\\nFor $7.99 a month, customers could obtain unlimited streaming of Netflix\\'s digital library and for another $7.99 per month they could have any of more than  .\\n100,000 DVD titles delivered to their home by mail.\\nThe growth of Netflix was one of the major factors that drove DVD rental chain Blockbuster into bankruptcy in 2010.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR NETFLIX Netflix attracted customers with its staggering selection and an excellent recommendation engine that allowed customers to access titles they were likely to enjoy.\\nWhereas a typical Blockbuster store offered 3,000 titles, Netflix had more than 100,000 titles available.\\nNetflix claimed that 95 percent of its customers received their DVDs within 24 hours of being shipped.\\nIn February 2000, Netflix introduced CineMatch, a program that made recommendations based on a customer\\'s rental history and preferences coupled with ratings from other users with similar interests.\\nNetflix had more than 3 billion movie ratings from members, with about 4 million movies being rated per day.\\nThe rating system had proven to be especially accurate, and 60 percent of all Netflix users selected their movies based on recommendations tailored to their individual tastes.2 The company used its recommendation technology to keep the DVD shipments moving and a greater number of its older DVD titles in circulation.\\nFor its digital content, Netflix allowed video streaming through a variety of devices including set-top boxes from Roku, Microsoft Xbox, Sony Play Station 3, and high-definition televisions from Sony and LG.\\nThe use of the Internet to view digital content had grown at a considerable rate.\\nIt was estimated that 48 percent of customers watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from 28 percent the previous year.3 This proportion was likely to grow in the future.\\nA challenge for Netflix was the delay the studios wanted to build in before allowing new movies to be available at Netflix.\\nGiven that the studios gained more revenue from DVD sales, they had negotiated a four-week delay from when the DVD was first available for sale to when it was available on Netflix.\\nThis was an artificial delay designed to support DVD sales through outlets like Wal-Mart.\\nIMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ON COSTS AT NETFLIX Netflix used the Internet to significantly lower its facility and inventory costs relative to Blockbuster.\\nNetflix aggregated its inventory at about 60 distribution centers in 2010.\\nThis allowed Netflix to hold significantly less inventory than Blockbuster, which held most of its inventory at thousands of retail stores.\\nIn 2009, about 70 percent of the DVDs shipped by Netflix were titles with release dates older than 13 weeks.4 Movie studios were happy that customers could view their older catalog (which otherwise provided little revenue) and thus offered Netflix these DVDs at cost and shared in the revenue that Netflix earned.\\nNot having to pay for older DVDs further lowered inventory costs at Netflix.\\nIn 2009, Netflix carried only $37 million in inventories (on sales of $1.67 billion), while Blockbuster carried $639 million in inventories (on sales of $4.06 billion).\\nNetflix had significantly lower facility costs than Blockbuster because it aggregated its operations in fewer than 60 distribution centers, while Blockbuster had thousands of stores it had to pay for.\\nWhereas $266 million in property and equipment at Netflix supported $1.67 billion of sales in 2009, Blockbuster required $2.37 billion in property and equipment to support $4.06 billion of sales.\\nTransportation Costs.\\nTransportation costs at Netflix were considerably higher than at Blockbuster.\\nThe Netflix CFO was quoted as stating that the company spent about $600 million in shipping DVDs in 2009.\\nAs people moved from DVDs to streaming, transportation costs were 2 Clive Thompson, \"If You Liked This, You\\'re Sure to Love That,\" New York Times, November 21, 2008, http://www.\\nnytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23Netflix-t.html.\\n3

+2 = very positive; +1 = positive; 0 = neutral; ?\\nIn fact, Netflix\\'s strategy was to buy more digital content using its savings in transportation costs as subscribers moved toward watching more content online.\\nInformation costs are higher to support the Netflix operations relative to Blockbuster.\\nWith the growth in digital streaming, information costs are likely to increase.\\nImpact of Online Sales on Performance at Netflix.\\nNetflix has significant advantages renting movies over the physical distribution channel of Blockbuster as shown in Table 4-13.\\nThese advantages are most pronounced for the wide selection of older movies that studios have in their catalogs.\\nFor newer movies, DVD vending machines from Redbox provide an effective channel with relatively low cost.\\nIn 2010, Blockbuster considered replacing its stores with thousands of vending machines as a major part of its recovery strategy.\\nThese vending machines carry only a few hundred titles consisting of new movies and popular children\\'s videos.\\nThey allow customers to go online and reserve movies at specific machines using a credit card.\\nThe result is a virtual aggregation of inventories, which improves the matching of supply and demand and reduces inventory expense.\\nThey are typically installed in existing retail infrastructure such as grocery stores.\\nThus, the marginal increase in property, plant, and equipment is small.\\nWhile Netflix exploited the Internet very effectively to mail DVDs from centralized DCs, it will find more challenges as it switches to being primarily a streaming service.\\nIt will face strong competition from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Hulu.\\nThe primary challenge for the streaming supply chain is sourcing content because the supply chain has relatively low investment in other assets.\\nNetflix will find it harder to maintain a competitive advantage in this space unlike its competition with Blockbuster.\\nThe ownership structure of the distribution network can have as big an impact as the type of distribution network.\\nThe bulk of this chapter deals with different types of physical networks and subsequent flows to distribute products successfully.\\nHowever, equally important is who owns each stage in the distribution network.\\nDistribution networks that have exactly  .\\nthe same physical flow but different ownership structures can have vastly different performance.\\nFor example, a manufacturer that owns its distribution network can control the network\\'s actions.\\nHowever, if the manufacturer does not own the distribution network, as is more often the case, a wide variety of issues need to be taken into account to optimize over the network.\\nObviously, an independent distributor wants to optimize its own enterprise, not necessarily the entire supply chain.\\nAttempting to optimize over a distribution network with multiple enterprises requires great skill in coordinating the incentives of each of the players and in creating the right relationships.\\nBe sure to consider the impact of both the physical flows and the ownership structure when designing a distribution network.\\nIt is important to have adaptable distribution networks.\\nDistribution networks must be able to adapt to changing technology and environments.\\nAn inability to adapt can be very damaging in these times of rapid change.\\nFor example, Blockbuster in the movie rental business and Borders in the bookselling business had great success with a network of retail stores.\\nTheir inability to adapt to the arrival of the Internet, however, allowed competitors like Amazon and Netflix to gain market share at their expense.\\nIf either Blockbuster or Borders had adapted to take advantage of the Internet to create a tailored distribution network, it can be argued that they could have continued their dominance.\\nWal-Mart is an example of a company that through trial and error adapted its distribution network to take advantage of the Internet along with its existing retail store network.\\nProduct price, commoditization, and criticality affect the type of distribution system preferred by customers.\\nInteractions between a buyer and a seller take time and resources.\\nAs a result, it is much more convenient for a buyer to deal with a single enterprise that can deliver a full line of products.\\nFor high-value, specialized, or critical products, customers are willing to have a relationship solely around that particular product.\\nFor low-value, commoditized products like office supplies, however, most customers prefer a one-stop shop.\\nThus, while customers are willing to order laptops directly from the manufacturer, they prefer to deal with a stationary supplier or store when looking to buy pens, paper, or staplers.\\nWhereas Apple has been successful with stores selling only Apple products, it is highly unlikely that a stapler manufacturer could succeed without distributing through general stationary stores.\\nIntegrate the Internet with the existing physical network.\\nTo extract maximum benefit from the online channel for physical goods, firms should integrate it with their existing supply chain networks.\\nSeparating the two networks often results in inefficiencies within the supply chain.\\nThis coupling of the online channel with the existing physical network has been referred to as \"clicks-and-mortar.\"\\nAlbertsons\\' use of its physical assets to satisfy both online orders and people who want to shop in a supermarket is an effective integration of online sales within a supply chain network.\\nAnother example of an effective clicks-and-mortar strategy is Wal-Mart, which allows customers to pick up online orders at its retail stores.\\nThe Internet is used to expand the variety available to customers at a Wal-Mart store.\\nWal-Mart stores stock popular items, whereas customers can order online the colors or sizes that may not be available in the store.\\nThis allows the Wal-Mart to centralize low-demand items while increasing the variety available to customers and extracting the maximum benefit from integrating its online sales with its physical network.\\nIdentify the key factors to be considered when designing a distribution network.\\nA manager must consider the customer needs to be met and the cost of meeting these needs when designing the distribution network.\\nSome key customer needs to be considered include response time, product variety/availability, convenience, order visibility, and returnability.\\nImportant costs that managers must consider include inventories, transportation, facilities and handling, and  .\\nIncreasing the number of facilities decreases the response time and transportation cost but increases inventory and facility cost.\\nDiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of various distribution options.\\nDistribution networks that ship directly to the customer are better suited for a large variety of high-value products that have low and uncertain demand.\\nThese networks carry low levels of inventory but incur high transportation cost and provide a slow response time.\\nDistribution networks that carry local inventory are suitable for products with high demand, especially if transportation is a large fraction of total cost.\\nThese networks incur higher inventory cost but lower transportation cost and provide a faster response time.\\nUnderstand how online sales have affected the design of distribution networks in different industries.\\nThe rise of online sales has affected both customer service and costs in supply chains.\\nOnline sales allow a firm to offer greater product variety and improve product availability by centralizing inventories.\\nThis is especially beneficial for low-volume, high-variety products.\\nThe online channel also improves the customer experience by providing 24-hour access and allowing a more customized experience.\\nSelling a product online, however, increases the response time relative to a retail store.\\nA company selling online reduces facility costs if there is no significant loss of customer participation.\\nTransportation costs increase, however, and this is particularly significant for low-value products with predictable demand.\\nOnline sales have been most effective for high-value products with uncertain demand, when customers are willing to wait some time before delivery.\\nThe Internet is particularly effective for products like music, movies, and books that can be digitized because the two major disadvantages of distributing physical products online--long response times and high transportation cost--disappear.\\n Understand the role of network design in a supply chain.\\nIdentify factors influencing supply chain network design decisions.\\nDevelop a framework for making network design decisions.\\nUse optimization for facility location and capacity allocation decisions.\\nIn this chapter, we start with the broad supply chain design discussed in Chapter 4 and focus on the fundamental questions of facility location, capacity allocation, and market allocation when designing a supply chain network.\\nWe identify and discuss the various factors that influence the facility location, capacity, and market allocation decisions.\\nWe then establish a framework and discuss various solution methodologies for network design decisions in a supply chain.\\nFacility role: What role should each facility play?\\nWhat processes are performed at each facility?\\nFacility location: Where should facilities be located?\\nCapacity allocation: How much capacity should be allocated to each facility?\\nMarket and supply allocation: What markets should each facility serve?\\nWhich supply sources should feed each facility?\\nNetwork design decisions have a significant impact on performance because they determine the supply chain configuration and set constraints within which the other supply chain drivers can be used either to decrease supply chain cost or to increase responsiveness.\\nAll network design decisions affect one another and must be made taking this fact into consideration.\\nDecisions concerning the role of each facility are significant because they determine 108  .\\nthe amount of flexibility the supply chain has in changing the way it meets demand.\\nFor example, Toyota has plants located worldwide in each market that it serves.\\nBefore 1997, each plant was capable of serving only its local market.\\nThis hurt Toyota when the Asian economy went into a recession in the late 1990s.\\nThe local plants in Asia had idle capacity that could not be used to serve other markets that were experiencing excess demand.\\nToyota has added flexibility to each plant to be able to serve markets other than the local one.\\nThis additional flexibility helps Toyota deal more effectively with changing global market conditions.\\nSimilarly, the flexibility of Honda\\'s U.S. plants to produce both SUVs and cars in the same plant was helpful in 2008 when SUV demand dropped but small car demand did not.\\nFacility location decisions have a long-term impact on a supply chain\\'s performance because it is expensive to shut down a facility or move it to a different location.\\nA good location decision can help a supply chain be responsive while keeping its costs low.\\nToyota, for example, built its first U.S. assembly plant in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1988 and has continued to build new plants in the United States since then.\\nThe U.S. plants proved profitable for Toyota when the yen strengthened and cars produced in Japan were too expensive to be cost competitive with cars produced in the United States.\\nLocal plants allowed Toyota to be responsive to the U.S. market while keeping costs low.\\nWhereas capacity allocation can be altered more easily than location, capacity decisions do tend to stay in place for several years.\\nAllocating too much capacity to a location results in poor utilization and, as a result, higher costs.\\nAllocating too little capacity results in poor responsiveness if demand is not satisfied or high cost if demand is filled from a distant facility.\\nThe allocation of supply sources and markets to facilities has a significant impact on performance because it affects total production, inventory, and transportation costs incurred by the supply chain to satisfy customer demand.\\nThis decision should be reconsidered on a regular basis so that the allocation can be changed as production and transportation costs, market conditions, or plant capacities change.\\nOf course, the allocation of markets and supply sources can be changed only if the facilities are flexible enough to serve different markets and receive supply from different sources.\\nNetwork design decisions must be revisited as market conditions change or when two companies merge.\\nFor example, as its subscriber base grew, Netflix added about 60 DCs by 2010 across the United States to lower transportation cost and improve responsiveness.\\nWith the growth in video streaming and the corresponding drop in DVD rentals, Netflix anticipated closing some of its DCs as DVD rental demand started to drop.\\nChanging the location and demand allocation of DCs with changing demand has been critical to maintaining low cost and responsiveness at Netflix.\\nFollowing a merger, consolidating some facilities and changing the location and role of others can often help reduce cost and improve responsiveness because of the redundancies and differences in markets served by either of the two separate firms.\\nNetwork design decisions may also need to be revisited if factor costs such as transportation have changed significantly.\\nIn 2008, P&G announced that it would rethink its distribution network, which was implemented when the \"cost of oil was $10 per barrel.\"\\nWe focus on developing a framework as well as methodologies that can be used for network design in a supply chain.\\nIn this section we examine a wide variety of factors that influence network design decisions in supply chains.\\nStrategic Factors A firm\\'s competitive strategy has a significant impact on network design decisions within the supply chain.\\nFirms that focus on cost leadership tend to find the lowest cost location for their manufacturing facilities, even if that means locating far from the markets they serve.\\nElectronic manufacturing service providers such as Foxconn and Flextronics have been successful in providing low-cost electronics assembly by locating their factories in low-cost countries such as  .\\nIn contrast, firms that focus on responsiveness tend to locate facilities closer to the market and may select a high-cost location if this choice allows the firm to react quickly to changing market needs.\\nZara, the Spanish apparel manufacturer, has a large fraction of its production capacity in Portugal and Spain despite the higher cost there.\\nThe local capacity allows the company to respond quickly to changing fashion trends in Europe.\\nThis responsiveness has allowed Zara to become one of the fastest growing apparel retailers in the world.\\nConvenience store chains aim to provide easy access to customers as part of their competitive strategy.\\nConvenience store networks thus include many stores that cover an area, with each store being relatively small.\\nIn contrast, discount stores such as Sam\\'s Club or Costco use a competitive strategy that focuses on providing low prices.\\nThus, their networks have large stores, and customers often have to travel many miles to get to one.\\nThe geographic area covered by one Sam\\'s Club store may include dozens of convenience stores.\\nGlobal supply chain networks can best support their strategic objectives with facilities in different countries playing different roles.\\nFor example, Zara has production facilities in Europe as well as Asia.\\nIts production facilities in Asia focus on low cost and primarily produce standardized, low-value products that sell in large amounts.\\nThe European facilities focus on being responsive and primarily produce cutting-edge designs whose demand is unpredictable.\\nThis combination of facilities allows Zara to produce a wide variety of products in the most profitable manner.\\nTechnological Factors Characteristics of available production technologies have a significant impact on network design decisions.\\nIf production technology displays significant economies of scale, a few high-capacity locations are most effective.\\nThis is the case in the manufacture of computer chips, for which factories require a large investment and the output is relatively inexpensive to transport.\\nAs a result, most semiconductor companies build a few high-capacity facilities.\\nIn contrast, if facilities have lower fixed costs, many local facilities are preferred because this helps lower transportation costs.\\nFor example, bottling plants for Coca-Cola do not have a high fixed cost.\\nTo reduce transportation costs, Coca-Cola sets up many bottling plants all over the world, each serving its local market.\\nMacroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors include taxes, tariffs, exchange rates, and shipping costs that are not internal to an individual firm.\\nAs global trade has increased, macroeconomic factors have had a significant influence on the success or failure of supply chain networks.\\nThus, it is imperative that firms take these factors into account when making network design decisions.\\nTARIFFS AND TAX INCENTIVES Tariffs refer to any duties that must be paid when products and/or equipment are moved across international, state, or city boundaries.\\nTariffs have a strong influence on location decisions within a supply chain.\\nIf a country has high tariffs, companies either do not serve the local market or set up manufacturing plants within the country to save on duties.\\nHigh tariffs lead to more production locations within a supply chain network, with each location having a lower allocated capacity.\\nAs tariffs have decreased with the World Trade Organization and regional agreements such as NAFTA (North America), the European Union, and MERCOSUR (South America), global firms have consolidated their global production and distribution facilities.\\nTax incentives are a reduction in tariffs or taxes that countries, states, and cities often provide to encourage firms to locate their facilities in specific areas.\\nMany countries vary incentives from city to city to encourage investments in areas with lower economic development.\\nSuch incentives are often a key factor in the final location decision for many plants.\\nBMW built its U.S. factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, mainly because of the tax incentives offered by that state.\\nDeveloping countries often create free trade zones in which duties and tariffs are relaxed as long as production is used primarily for export.\\nThis creates a strong incentive for global firms to set up plants in these countries to be able to exploit their low labor costs.\\nIn China, for example, the establishment of a free trade zone near Guangzhou led to many global firms locating facilities there in the 1990s.\\nA large number of developing countries also provide additional tax incentives based on training, meals, transportation, and other facilities offered to the workforce.\\nTariffs may also vary based on the product\\'s level of technology.\\nChina, for example, waived tariffs entirely for \"high-tech\" products, in an effort to encourage companies to locate there and bring in stateof-the-art technology.\\nMotorola located a large chip manufacturing plant in China to take advantage of the reduced tariffs and other incentives available to high-tech products.\\nMany countries also place minimum requirements on local content and limits on imports to help develop local manufacturers.\\nSuch policies lead global companies to set up local facilities and source from local suppliers.\\nFor example, the Spanish company Gamesa was a dominant supplier of wind turbines to China, owning about a third of the market share in 2005.\\nIn that year, China declared that wind farms had to buy equipment in which at least 70 percent of content was local.\\nThis forced players like Gamesa and GE that wanted a piece of the Chinese market to train local suppliers and source from them.\\nIn 2009, China revoked the local content requirements.\\nBy then, Chinese suppliers had sufficiently large scale to achieve some of the lowest costs in the world.\\nThese suppliers also sold parts to Gamesa\\'s Chinese competitors who developed into dominant global players.\\nEXCHANGE-RATE AND DEMAND RISK Fluctuations in exchange rates are common and have a significant impact on the profits of any supply chain serving global markets.\\nFor example, the dollar fluctuated between a high of 124 yen in 2007 and a low of 81 yen in 2010.\\nA firm that sells its product in the United States with production in Japan is exposed to the risk of appreciation of the yen.\\nThe cost of production is incurred in yen, whereas revenues are obtained in dollars.\\nThus, an increase in the value of the yen increases the production cost in dollars, decreasing the firm\\'s profits.\\nIn the 1980s, many Japanese manufacturers faced this problem when the yen appreciated in value because most of their production capacity was located in Japan.\\nThe appreciation of the yen decreased their revenues (in terms of yen) from large overseas markets, and they saw their profits decline.\\nMost Japanese manufacturers responded by building production facilities all over the world.\\nThe dollar fluctuated between 0.63 and 1.15 euros in the six years between 2002 and 2008, dropping to 0.63 euro in July 2008.\\nThe drop in the dollar was particularly negative for European automakers such as Daimler, BMW, and Porsche, which export many vehicles to the United States.\\nIt was reported that every one-cent rise in the euro cost BMW and Mercedes roughly $75 million each per year.\\nBy June 2010, however, the dollar had reached as high as 0.83 euro.\\nExchange-rate risks may be handled using financial instruments that limit, or hedge against, the loss due to fluctuations.\\nSuitably designed supply chain networks, however, offer the opportunity to take advantage of exchange-rate fluctuations and increase profits.\\nAn effective way to do this is to build some overcapacity into the network and make the capacity flexible so that it can be used to supply different markets.\\nThis flexibility allows the firm to react to exchange-rate fluctuations by altering production flows within the supply chain to maximize profits.\\nCompanies must also take into account fluctuations in demand caused by changes in the economies of different countries.\\nFor example, 2009 was a year in which the economies of the United States and Western Europe shrank (real GDP in the United States decreased by 2.4 percent) while that in China grew by more than 8 percent and in India by about 7 percent.\\nDuring this period, global companies with presence in China and India and the flexibility to divert resources from shrinking to growing markets did a lot better than those that did not have either presence in these markets or the flexibility.\\nAs the economies of Brazil, China, and India continue to grow, global supply chains will have to build more local presence in these countries along with the flexibility to serve multiple markets.\\nFREIGHT AND FUEL COSTS Fluctuations in freight and fuel costs have a significant impact on the profits of any global supply chain.\\nFor example, in 2010 alone, the Baltic Dry Index, which measures changes in the cost to transport raw materials such as metals, grains, and fossil fuels, peaked at 4,187 in May and hit a low of 1,709 in July.\\nCrude oil prices were as low as about $31 per barrel in February 2009 and increased to about $90 per barrel by December 2010.\\nIt can be difficult to deal with this extent of price fluctuation even with supply chain flexibility.\\nSuch fluctuations are best dealt with by hedging prices on commodity markets or signing suitable long-term contracts.\\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, a significant fraction of Southwest Airline\\'s profits were attributed to fuel hedges it had purchased at good prices.\\nWhen designing supply chain networks, companies must account for fluctuations in exchange rates, demand, and freight and fuel costs.\\nPolitical Factors The political stability of the country under consideration plays a significant role in location choice.\\nCompanies prefer to locate facilities in politically stable countries where the rules of commerce and ownership are well defined.\\nWhile political risk is hard to quantify, there are some indices like the global political risk index (GPRI) that companies can use when investing in emerging markets.\\nThe GPRI is evaluated by a consulting firm (Eurasia Group) and aims to measure the capacity of a country to withstand shocks or crises along four categories: government, society, security, and economy.\\nInfrastructure Factors The availability of good infrastructure is an important prerequisite to locating a facility in a given area.\\nPoor infrastructure adds to the cost of doing business from a given location.\\nIn the 1990s, global companies located their factories in China near Shanghai, Tianjin, or Guangzhou--even though these locations did not have the lowest labor or land costs--because these locations had good infrastructure .\\nKey infrastructure elements to be considered during network design include availability of sites and labor, proximity to transportation terminals, rail service, proximity to airports and seaports, highway access, congestion, and local utilities.\\nCompetitive Factors Companies must consider competitors\\' strategy, size, and location when designing their supply chain networks.\\nA fundamental decision firms make is whether to locate their facilities close to or far from competitors.\\nThe form of competition and factors such as raw material or labor availability influence this decision.\\nPOSITIVE EXTERNALITIES BETWEEN FIRMS Positive externalities occur when the collocation of multiple firms benefits all of them.\\nPositive externalities lead to competitors locating close to each other.\\nFor example, retail stores tend to locate close to each other because doing so increases overall demand, thus benefiting all parties.\\nBy locating together in a mall, competing retail stores make it more convenient for customers, who need drive to only one location to find everything they are looking for.\\nThis increases the total number of customers who visit the mall, increasing demand for all stores located there.\\nAnother example of positive externality occurs when the presence of a competitor leads to the development of appropriate infrastructure in a developing area.\\nIn India, Suzuki was the first foreign auto manufacturer to set up a manufacturing facility.\\nThe company went to considerable effort and built a local supplier network.\\nGiven the well-established supplier base in India, Suzuki\\'s competitors have also built assembly plants there, because they now find it more effective to build cars in India rather than import them to the country.\\n1  LOCATING TO SPLIT THE MARKET When there are no positive externalities, firms locate to be able to capture the largest possible share of the market.\\nA simple model first proposed by Hotelling explains the issues behind this decision.1 When firms do not control price but compete on distance from the customer, they can maximize market share by locating close to each other and splitting the market.\\nConsider a situation in which customers are uniformly located along the line segment between 0 and 1 and two firms compete based on their distance from the customer as shown in Figure 5-1.\\nA customer goes to the closer firm and customers who are equidistant from the two firms are evenly split between them.\\nIf total demand is 1, Firm 1 locates at point a, and Firm 2 locates at point 1 b, the demand at the two firms, d1 and d2, is given by  d1 = a +  1-b-a 2  and d2 =  1+b-a 2  Both firms maximize their market share if they move closer to each other and locate at a  b  1/2.\\nObserve that when both firms locate in the middle of the line segment (a  b  1/2), the average distance that customers have to travel is 1/4.\\nIf one firm locates at 1/4 and the other at 3/4, the average distance customers have to travel drops to 1/8 (customers between 0 and 1/2 come to Firm 1 located at 1/4 while customers between 1/2 and 1 come to Firm 2 located at 3/4).\\nThis set of locations, however, is not an equilibrium because it gives both firms an incentive to try to increase market share by moving to the middle (closer to 1/2).\\nThe result of competition is for both firms to locate close together even though doing so increases the average distance to the customer.\\nIf the firms compete on price and the customer incurs the transportation cost, it may be optimal for the two firms to locate as far apart as possible,2 with Firm 1 locating at 0 and Firm 2 locating at 1.\\nLocating far from each other minimizes price competition and helps the firms split the market and maximize profits.\\nCustomer Response Time and Local Presence Firms that target customers who value a short response time must locate close to them.\\nCustomers are unlikely to come to a convenience store if they have to travel a long distance to get there.\\nIt is thus best for a convenience store chain to have many stores distributed in an area so that most people have a convenience store close to them.\\nIn contrast, customers shop for larger quantity of goods at supermarkets and are willing to travel longer distances to get to one.\\nThus, supermarket chains tend to have stores that are larger than convenience stores and not as densely distributed.\\nMost towns have fewer supermarkets than convenience stores.\\nDiscounters such as Sam\\'s Club target customers who are even less time sensitive.\\nThese stores are even larger than supermarkets and there are fewer of them in an area.\\nW.W. Grainger uses about 400 facilities all over the United States to provide same-day delivery of maintenance and repair supplies to many of its customers.\\nMcMaster-Carr, a competitor, targets customers who are willing to wait for  1 Jean Tirole, The Theory of Industrial Organization (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1997), 279.\\nMcMaster-Carr has only five facilities throughout the United States and is able to provide next-day delivery to a large number of customers.\\nIf a firm is delivering its product to customers, use of a rapid means of transportation allows it to build fewer facilities and still provide a short response time.\\nThis option, however, increases transportation cost.\\nMoreover, there are many situations in which the presence of a facility close to a customer is important.\\nA coffee shop is likely to attract customers who live or work nearby.\\nNo faster mode of transport can serve as a substitute and be used to attract customers who are far away from the coffee shop.\\nLogistics and Facility Costs Logistics and facility costs incurred within a supply chain change as the number of facilities, their location, and capacity allocation change.\\nCompanies must consider inventory, transportation, and facility costs when designing their supply chain networks.\\nInventory and facility costs increase as the number of facilities in a supply chain increases.\\nTransportation costs decrease as the number of facilities increases.\\nIf the number of facilities increases to the point at which inbound economies of scale are lost, then transportation costs increase.\\nFor example, with few facilities Amazon has lower inventory and facility costs than Barnes & Noble, which has hundreds of stores.\\nBarnes & Noble, however, has lower transportation costs.\\nThe supply chain network design is also influenced by the transformation occurring at each facility.\\nWhen there is a significant reduction in material weight or volume as a result of processing, it may be better to locate facilities closer to the supply source rather than the customer.\\nFor example, when iron ore is processed to make steel, the amount of output is a small fraction of the amount of ore used.\\nLocating the steel factory close to the supply source is preferred because it reduces the distance that the large quantity of ore has to travel.\\nTotal logistics costs are the sum of the inventory, transportation, and facility costs.\\nThe facilities in a supply chain network should at least equal the number that minimizes total logistics cost.\\nA firm may increase the number of facilities beyond this point to improve the response time to its customers.\\nThis decision is justified if the revenue increase from improved response outweighs the increased cost from additional facilities.\\nIn the next section we discuss a framework for making network design decisions.\\nPhase I: Define a Supply Chain Strategy/Design The objective of the first phase of network design is to define a firm\\'s broad supply chain design.\\nThis includes determining the stages in the supply chain and whether each supply chain function will be performed in-house or outsourced (see Chapter 4).\\nPhase I starts with a clear definition of the firm\\'s competitive strategy as the set of customer needs that the supply chain aims to satisfy.\\nThe supply chain strategy then specifies what capabilities the supply chain network must have to support the competitive strategy (see Chapter 2).\\nNext, managers must forecast the likely evolution of global competition and whether competitors in each market will be local or global players.\\nManagers must also identify constraints on available capital and whether growth will be accomplished by acquiring existing facilities, building new facilities, or partnering.\\nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGY INTERNAL CONSTRAINTS Capital, growth strategy, existing network PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES Cost, scale/scope impact, support required, flexibility COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AGGREGATE FACTOR AND LOGISTICS COSTS  .\\nPHASE I Supply Chain Strategy  GLOBAL COMPETITION  PHASE II Regional Facility Configuration  TARIFFS AND

AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE  FACTOR COSTS Labor, materials, site specific  PHASE IV Location Choices  .\\nLOGISTICS COSTS Transport, inventory, coordination  Based on the competitive strategy of the firm, its resulting supply chain strategy, an analysis of the competition, any economies of scale or scope, and any constraints, managers must determine the broad supply chain design for the firm.\\nPhase II: Define the Regional Facility Configuration The objective of the second phase of network design is to identify regions where facilities will be located, their potential roles, and their approximate capacity.\\nAn analysis of Phase II starts with a forecast of the demand by country or region.\\nSuch a forecast must include a measure of the size of the demand and a determination of the homogeneity or variability of customer requirements across different regions.\\nHomogeneous requirements favor large consolidated facilities, whereas requirements that vary across countries favor smaller, localized facilities.\\nThe next step is for managers to identify whether economies of scale or scope can play a significant role in reducing costs, given available production technologies.\\nIf economies of scale or scope are significant, it may be better to have a few facilities serving many markets.\\nFor example, semiconductor manufacturers such as Advanced Micro Devices have few plants for their global markets, given the economies of scale in production.\\nIf economies of scale or scope is not significant, it may be better for each market to have its own facility.\\nNext, managers must identify demand risk, exchange-rate risk, and political risk associated with regional markets.\\nThey must also identify regional tariffs, any requirements for local production, tax incentives, and any export or import restrictions for each market.\\nThe tax and tariff information is used to identify the best location to extract a major share of the profits.\\nIn general, it is best to obtain the major share of profits at the location with the lowest tax rate.\\nManagers must identify competitors in each region and make a case for whether a facility needs to be located close to or far from a competitor\\'s facility.\\nThe desired response time for each market and logistics costs at an aggregate level in each region must also be identified.\\nBased on all this information, managers identify the regional facility configuration for the supply chain network using network design models discussed in the next section.\\nThe regional configuration defines the approximate number of facilities in the network, regions where facilities will be set up, and whether a facility will produce all products for a given market or a few products for all markets in the network.\\nPhase III: Select a Set of Desirable Potential Sites The objective of Phase III is to select a set of desirable potential sites within each region where facilities are to be located.\\nSites should be selected based on an analysis of infrastructure availability to support the desired production methodologies.\\nHard infrastructure requirements include the availability of suppliers, transportation services, communication, utilities, and warehousing facilities.\\nSoft infrastructure requirements include the availability of a skilled workforce, workforce turnover, and the community receptivity to business and industry.\\nPhase IV: Location Choices The objective of Phase IV is to select a precise location and capacity allocation for each facility.\\nAttention is restricted to the desirable potential sites selected in Phase III.\\nThe network is designed to maximize total profits, taking into account the expected margin and demand in each market, various logistics and facility costs, and the taxes and tariffs at each location.\\nIn the next section, we discuss methodologies for making facility location and capacity allocation decisions during Phases II to IV.\\nA manager\\'s goal when locating facilities and allocating capacity should be to maximize the overall profitability of the resulting supply chain network while providing customers with the appropriate responsiveness.\\nRevenues come from the sale of product, whereas costs arise from facilities, labor, transportation, material, and inventories.\\nThe profits of the firm are also affected by taxes and tariffs.\\nIdeally, profits after tariffs and taxes should be maximized when designing a supply chain network.\\nA manager must consider many trade-offs during network design.\\nFor example, building many facilities to serve local markets reduces transportation cost and provides a fast response time, but it increases the facility and inventory costs incurred by the firm.\\nManagers use network design models in two situations.\\nFirst, these models are used to decide on locations where facilities will be established and the capacity to be assigned to each facility.\\nManagers must make this decision considering a time horizon over which locations and capacities will not be altered (typically in years).\\nSecond, these models are used to assign current demand to the available facilities and identify lanes along which product will be transported.\\nManagers must consider this decision at least on an annual basis as demand, prices, exchange rates, and tariffs change.\\nIn both cases, the goal is to maximize the profit while satisfying customer needs.\\nThe following information ideally is available in making the design decision: ?Location of supply sources and markets ?Location of potential facility sites  .\\n?Demand forecast by market ?Facility, labor, and material costs by site ?Transportation costs between each pair of sites ?Inventory costs by site and as a function of quantity ?Sale price of product in different regions ?Taxes and tariffs ?Desired response time and other service factors Given this information, either gravity models or network optimization models may be used to design the network.\\nWe organize the models according to the phase of the network design framework at which each model is likely to be useful.\\nPhase II: Network Optimization Models During Phase II of the network design framework (see Figure 5-2), a manager considers regional demand, tariffs, economies of scale, and aggregate factor costs to decide the regions where facilities are to be located.\\nAs an example, consider SunOil, a manufacturer of petrochemical products with worldwide sales.\\nThe vice president of supply chain is considering several options to meet demand.\\nOne possibility is to set up a facility in each region.\\nThe advantage of such an approach is that it lowers transportation cost and also helps avoid duties that may be imposed if product is imported from other regions.\\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that plants are sized to meet local demand and may not fully exploit economies of scale.\\nAn alternative approach is to consolidate plants in just a few regions.\\nThis improves economies of scale but increases transportation cost and duties.\\nDuring Phase II, the manager must consider these quantifiable trade-offs along with nonquantifiable factors such as the competitive environment and political risk.\\nNetwork optimization models are useful for managers considering regional configuration during Phase II.\\nThe first step is to collect the data in a form that can be used for a quantitative model.\\nFor SunOil, the vice president of supply chain decides to view the worldwide demand in terms of five regions--North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\\nThe data collected are shown in Figure 5-3.\\nAnnual demand for each of the five regions is shown in cells B9:F9.\\nCells B4:F8 contain the variable production, inventory, and transportation cost (including tariffs and duties) of producing in one region to meet demand in each individual region.\\nAll costs are in thousands of dollars.\\nFor example, as shown in cell C4, it costs $92,000 (including duties) to produce 1 million units in North America and sell them in South America.\\nAs shown in cell G4, it costs $6,000,000 in annualized fixed cost to build a low-capacity plant in North America.\\nObserve that the data collected at this stage are at a fairly aggregate level.\\nThere are fixed as well as variable costs associated with facilities, transportation, and inventories at each facility.\\nFixed costs are those that are incurred no matter how much is produced or shipped from a facility.\\nVariable costs are those that are incurred in proportion to the quantity produced or shipped from a given facility.\\nFacility, transportation, and inventory costs .\\ngenerally display economies of scale, and the marginal cost decreases as the quantity produced at a facility increases.\\nIn the models we consider, however, all variable costs grow linearly with the quantity produced or shipped.\\nSunOil is considering two plant sizes in each location.\\nLow-capacity plants can produce 10 million units a year, whereas high-capacity plants can produce 20 million units a year, as shown in cells H4:H8 and J4:J8, respectively.\\nHigh-capacity plants exhibit some economies of scale and have fixed costs that are less than twice the fixed costs of a low-capacity plant, as shown in cells I4:I8.\\nAll fixed costs are annualized.\\nThe vice president wants to know what the lowest cost network should look like.\\nTo answer this question, we next discuss the capacitated plant location model, which can be used in this setting.\\nTHE CAPACITATED PLANT LOCATION MODEL The capacitated plant location network optimization model requires the following inputs:  n  number of potential plant locations/capacity (each level of capacity will count as a separate location) m  number of markets or demand points Dj  annual demand from market j Ki  potential capacity of plant i fi  annualized fixed cost of keeping plant i open cij  cost of producing and shipping one unit from plant i to market j (cost includes production, inventory, transportation, and tariffs)  The supply chain team\\'s goal is to decide on a network design that maximizes profits after taxes.\\nFor the sake of simplicity, however, we assume that all demand must be met and taxes on earnings are ignored.\\nThe model thus focuses on minimizing the cost of meeting global demand.\\nIt can, however, be modified to include profits and taxes.\\nDefine the following decision variables:  yi  1 if plant i is open, 0 otherwise xij  quantity shipped from plant i to market j  The problem is then formulated as the following integer program:  n nm Min a fiyi + a a cij xij i=1 i=1j=1  subject to  n a xij = Dj for j = 1, ?, m i=1 m a xij ... Kiyi for i = 1, ?, n j=1 yi  {0, 1} for i = 1, ?, n, xij ?0  .\\nThe solution identifies the plants that are to be kept open, their capacity, and the allocation of regional demand to these plants.\\nThe model is solved using the Solver tool in Excel.\\nGiven the data, the next step in Excel is to identify cells corresponding to each decision variable as shown in Figure 5-4.\\nCells B14:F18 correspond to the decision variables xij and determine the amount produced in a supply region and shipped to a demand region.\\nCells G14:G18 contain the decision variables yi corresponding to the low-capacity plants, and cells H14:H18 contain the decision variables yi corresponding to the high-capacity plants.\\nInitially, all decision variables are set to be 0. .\\nThe constraint cells and objective function are shown in Figure 5-5.\\nfixed cost plus the variable cost of operating the network.\\nThe next step is to use Data Solver to invoke Solver as shown in Figure 5-6.\\nWithin Solver, the goal is to minimize the total cost in cell B31.\\nThe variables are in cells B14:H18.\\nThe constraints are as follows:  B14:H18 ?0 EAll decision variables are nonnegativeF  B22:B26 ?0 B28:F28 = 0  m e Kiyi -a xij ?0 for i = 1, ?,5 f j=1 n e Dj -

Kiyi for i = 1, ?, n j=1 xij, yi  {0,1}  .\\nWe do not describe the solution of the model in Excel because it is very similar to the model discussed earlier.\\nThe optimal network with single sourcing for TelecomOptic is as shown in Table 5-4.\\nIf single sourcing is required, it is optimal for TelecomOptic to close the factories in Baltimore and Cheyenne.\\nThis is different from the result in Figure 5-12, in which factories in Salt Lake City and Wichita were closed.\\nThe monthly cost of operating the network in Table 5-4 is $49,717,000.\\nThis cost is about $2.3 million higher than the cost of the network in Figure 5-12, in which single sourcing was not required.\\nThe supply chain team thus concludes that single sourcing adds about $2.3 million per month to the cost of the supply chain network, although it makes coordination easier and requires less flexibility from the plants.\\nTable 5-4 Optimal Network Configuration for TelecomOptic with Single Sourcing  Open/Closed Atlanta Boston Chicago Denver Omaha Portland  Baltimore Cheyenne Salt Lake Memphis Wichita  Closed Closed Open Open Open  00 00 00 10 8 00  00 00 06 00 14 0  00 00 0 11 00 70  LOCATING PLANTS AND WAREHOUSES SIMULTANEOUSLY A much more general form of the plant location model needs to be considered if the entire supply chain network from the supplier to the customer is to be designed.\\nWe consider a supply chain in which suppliers send material to factories that supply warehouses that supply markets as shown in Figure 5-13.\\nLocation and capacity allocation decisions have to be made for both factories and warehouses.\\nMultiple warehouses may be used to satisfy demand at a market, and multiple factories may be used to replenish warehouses.\\nIt is also assumed that units have been appropriately adjusted such that one unit of input from a supply source produces one unit of the finished product.\\nThe model requires the following inputs: m  number of markets or demand points n  number of potential factory locations l  number of suppliers t  number of potential warehouse locations Dj  annual demand from customer j Ki  potential capacity of factory at site i Sh  supply capacity at supplier h We  potential warehouse capacity at site e Fi  fixed cost of locating a plant at site i fe  fixed cost of locating a warehouse at site e chi  cost of shipping one unit from supply source h to factory i cie  cost of producing and shipping one unit from factory i to warehouse e cej  cost of shipping one unit from warehouse e to customer j  Suppliers Plants  Warehouses  Markets  .\\nThe goal is to identify plant and warehouse locations as well as quantities shipped between various points that minimize the total fixed and variable costs.\\nDefine the following decision variables: yi  1 if factory is located at site i, 0 otherwise ye  1 if warehouse is located at site e, 0 otherwise xej  quantity shipped from warehouse e to market j xie  quantity shipped from factory at site i to warehouse e xhi  quantity shipped from supplier h to factory at site i The problem is formulated as the following integer program:  n t ln  nt  tm  Min a Fiyi + a feye + a a chixhi + a a ciexie + a a cejxej  i=1 e=1 h=1i=1  i=1e=1  e=1j=1  The objective function minimizes the total fixed and variable costs of the supply chain network subject to the following constraints:  n a x hi ... Sh for h = 1, ?, l i=1  .\\nlt a x hi - a x ie ?0 for i =1, ?, n h=1 e=1  .\\nt a xie ... Kiyi for i = 1, ?, n e=1  .\\nnm a x ie - a x ej ?0 for e = 1, ?, t i=1 j=1  .\\nm a x ej ... Weye for e = 1, ?, t j=1  .\\nt a x ej = Dj for j = 1, ?, m e=1  .\\nyi, ye  {0,1}, x ej, x ie, x hi ?0  .\\nThe model discussed earlier can be modified to allow direct shipments between factories and markets.\\nAll the models discussed previously can also be modified to accommodate economies of scale in production, transportation, and inventory costs.\\nHowever, these requirements make the models more difficult to solve.\\nAccounting for Taxes, Tariffs, and Customer Requirements  Network design models should be structured such that the resulting supply chain network maximizes profits after tariffs and taxes while meeting customer service requirements.\\nThe models discussed earlier can easily be modified to maximize profits accounting for taxes, even when revenues are in different currencies.\\nIf rj is the revenue from selling one unit in market j, the objective function of the capacitated plant location model can be modified to be  mn  n  nm  Max a rj a x ij - a Fiyi - a a cij x ij  j=1 i=1  i=1  i=1j=1  .\\nn a x ij ... Dj for j = 1, ?, m i=1  .\\nbecause it allows the network designer to identify the demand that can be satisfied profitably and .\\nof demand that is profitable to serve.\\nThis may result in some markets in which a portion of the demand is dropped, unless constrained otherwise, because it cannot be served profitably.\\nCustomer preferences and requirements may be in terms of desired response time and the choice of transportation mode or transportation provider.\\nConsider, for example, two modes of transportation available between plant location i and market j. Mode 1 may be sea and mode 2 may be air.\\nThe plant location model is modified by defining two distinct decision variables xi1j and xi2j corresponding to the quantity shipped from location i to market j using modes 1 and 2, respectively.\\nThe desired response time using each transportation mode is accounted for by allowing shipments only when the time taken is less than the desired response time.\\nFor example, if the time from location i to market j using mode 1 (sea) is longer than would be acceptable to the customer, we simply drop the decision variable xi1j from the plant location model.\\nThe option among several transportation providers can be modeled similarly.\\nManagers should keep the following issues in mind when making network design decisions for a supply chain.\\nDo not underestimate the life span of facilities.\\nIt is important to think through the long-term consequences of facility decisions because facilities last a long time and have an enduring impact on a firm\\'s performance.\\nManagers must consider not only future demand and costs but also scenarios in which technology may change.\\nOtherwise, facilities may become useless within a few years.\\nFor example, an insurance company moved its clerical labor from a metropolitan location to a suburban location to lower costs.\\nWith increasing automation, the need for clerical labor decreased significantly, and within a few years the facility was no longer needed.\\nThe company found it difficult to sell the facility given its distance from  .\\nresidential areas and airports.3 Within most supply chains, production facilities are harder to change than storage facilities.\\nSupply chain network designers must consider that any factories that they put in place will stay there for an extended period of a decade or more.\\nWarehouses or storage facilities, particularly those that are not owned by the company, can be changed within a year of making the decision.\\nDo not gloss over the cultural implications.\\nNetwork design decisions regarding facility location and facility role have a significant impact on the culture of each facility and the firm.\\nThe culture at a facility will be influenced by other facilities in its vicinity.\\nNetwork designers can use this fact to influence the role of the new facility and the focus of people working there.\\nFor example, when Ford Motor Company introduced the Lincoln Mark VIII model, management was faced with a dilemma.\\nAt that time, the Mark VIII shared a platform with the Mercury Cougar.\\nHowever, the Mark VIII was part of Ford\\'s luxury Lincoln division.\\nLocating the Mark VIII line with the Cougar would have obvious operational advantages because of shared parts and processes.\\nHowever, Ford decided to locate the Mark VIII line in the Wixom, Michigan, plant, where other Lincoln cars were produced.\\nThe primary reason for doing so was to ensure that the focus on quality for the Mark VIII would be consistent with that of other Ford luxury cars that were produced in Wixom.\\nThe location of a facility has a significant impact on the extent and form of communication that develops in the supply chain network.\\nLocating a facility far from headquarters will likely give it more of a culture of autonomy.\\nThis may be beneficial if the firm is starting a new division that needs to function in a manner different from that of the rest of the company.\\nIn contrast, locating two facilities closer together is likely to encourage communication between them.\\nExtensive communication can be useful if decisions made at either facility have a strong impact on the performance of the other facility.\\nDo not ignore quality-of-life issues.\\nThe quality of life at selected facility locations has a significant impact on performance because it influences the workforce available and its morale.\\nIn many instances, a firm may be better off selecting a higher cost location if it provides a much better quality of life.\\nFailure to do so can have dire consequences.\\nFor example, an aerospace supplier decided to relocate an entire division to an area with a lower standard of living in order to reduce costs.\\nMost of the marketing team, however, refused to relocate.\\nAs a result, customer relations deteriorated, and the company had a very difficult transition.\\nThe effort to save costs hurt the company and effectively curtailed the firm\\'s status as a major player in its market.4 Focus on tariffs and tax incentives when locating facilities.\\nManagers making facility location decisions should consider tariffs and tax incentives carefully.\\nWhen considering international locations, it is astounding how often tax incentives drive the choice of location, often overcoming all of the other cost factors combined.\\nFor instance, Ireland has developed a large high-tech industry by enticing companies with low taxes.\\nEven within nations, local governments may offer generous packages of low to no taxes and free land when firms decide to locate facilities within their jurisdiction.\\nToyota, BMW, and Mercedes have all chosen their facility locations in the United States due in large part to tax incentives offered by different states.\\nUnderstand the role of network design in a supply chain.\\nNetwork design decisions include identifying facility roles, locations, and capacities and allocating markets to be served by different facilities.\\nThese decisions define the physical constraints within which the network must be operated as market conditions change.\\nGood network design decisions increase supply chain profits.\\nIdentify factors influencing supply chain network design decisions.\\nBroadly speaking, network design decisions are influenced by strategic, technological, macroeconomic, political, infrastructure, competitive, and operational factors.\\n3 Charles F. Harding, \"Quantifying Abstract Factors in Facility-Location Decisions,\" Industrial Development (May胡une 1988): 24.\\nDevelop a framework for making network design decisions.\\nThe goal of network design is to maximize the supply chain\\'s long-term profitability.\\nThe process starts by defining the supply chain strategy, which must be aligned with the competitive strategy of the firm.\\nThe supply chain strategy, regional demand, costs, infrastructure, and the competitive environment are used to define a regional facility configuration.\\nFor regions where facilities are to be located, potentially attractive sites are then selected based on available infrastructure.\\nThe optimal configuration is determined from the potential sites using demand, logistics cost, factor costs, taxes, and margins in different markets.\\nUse optimization for facility location and capacity allocation decisions.\\nGravity location models identify a location that minimizes inbound and outbound transportation costs.\\nThey are simple to implement but do not account for other important costs.\\nNetwork optimization models can include contribution margins, taxes, tariffs, production, transportation, and inventory costs and are used to maximize profitability.\\nThese models are useful when locating facilities, allocating capacity to facilities, and allocating markets to facilities.\\n Identify factors that need to be included in total cost when making global sourcing decisions.\\nDefine uncertainties that are particularly relevant when designing global supply chains.\\nExplain different strategies that may be used to mitigate risk in global supply chains.\\nUnderstand decision tree methodologies used to evaluate supply chain design decisions under uncertainty.\\nGlobalization has offered tremendous opportunity as well as increased risk in the development of supply chains.\\nHigh-performance supply chains such as Nokia and Zara have taken full advantage of globalization.\\nIn contrast, several supply chains have found themselves unprepared for the increased risk that has accompanied globalization.\\nAs a result, managers must account for both opportunities and uncertainties over the long term when designing a global supply chain network.\\nIn this chapter, we identify sources of risk for global supply chains, discuss risk mitigation strategies, detail the methodologies used to evaluate network design decisions under uncertainty, and show how they improve global supply chain decisions.\\nGlobalization offers companies opportunities to simultaneously grow revenues and decrease costs.\\nIn its 2008 annual report, P&G reported that more than a third of the company sales growth was from developing markets with a profit margin that was comparable to developed market margins.\\nBy 2010, sales for the company in developing markets represented almost 34 percent of global sales.\\nSimilarly, Nokia\\'s two largest global markets in 2009, in terms of net sales, were China and India.\\nSales in these two countries represented almost 21.5 percent, and sales in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) represented more than 28 percent of Nokia\\'s global sales in 2009.\\nClearly, globalization has offered both P&G and Nokia a significant revenue enhancement opportunity.\\nApparel and consumer electronics are two areas in which globalization has offered significant cost reduction opportunities.\\nConsumer electronics focuses on small, lightweight, high-value items that are relatively easy and inexpensive to ship.\\nCompanies have exploited large economies of scale by consolidating production of standardized electronics components in a single location for use in multiple products across the globe.\\nContract manufacturers like Foxconn and Flextronics have become giants with facilities in low-cost countries.\\nApparel manufacture has high labor content and the product is relatively lightweight and cost effective to transport.\\nCompanies have exploited globalization by shifting much apparel manufacturing to low-labor-cost countries, especially China.\\nIn the first half of 2009, about 33 percent of U.S. imports of apparel were from China.\\nThe net result is that both industries have benefited tremendously from cost reduction as a result of globalization.\\nOne must keep in mind, however, that the opportunities from globalization are often accompanied by significant additional risk.\\nIn a survey conducted by the consulting company Accenture in 2006, more than 50 percent of the executives surveyed believed that supply chain risk had increased as a result of their global operations strategy.\\nFor example, in 2005, hurricane damage to 40,000 acres of plantations decreased Dole\\'s global banana production by about 25 percent.\\nComponent shortage when Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 game console hurt revenues and Sony\\'s stock price.\\nThe ability to incorporate suitable risk mitigation into supply chain design has often been the difference between global supply chains that have succeeded and those that have not.\\nThe Accenture survey categorized risk in global supply chains as shown in Table 6-1 and asked respondents to indicate the factors that affected them.\\nMore than a third of the respondents were impacted by natural disasters, volatility of fuel prices, and the performance of supply chain partners.\\nCrude oil spot price and exchange rate fluctuations in 2008 illustrate the extreme volatility that global supply chains must deal with.\\nCrude started 2008 at about $90 per barrel, peaked in July at more than $140 per barrel, and plummeted to below $40 per barrel in December.\\nThe euro started 2008 at about $1.47, peaked in July at almost $1.60, dropped to about $1.25 at the end of October, and then rose back to $1.46 toward the end of December.\\nOne can only imagine the havoc such fluctuation played on supply chain performance in 2008!\\nSimilar fluctuations in exchange rates and crude prices have continued since then.\\nThe only constant in global supply chain management seems to be uncertainty.\\nOver the life of a supply chain network, a company experiences fluctuations in demand, prices, exchange rates, and the competitive environment.\\nA decision that looks good under the current environment may be quite poor if the situation changes.\\nBetween 2000 and 2008, the euro fluctuated from a low of $0.84 to a high of almost $1.60.\\nClearly, supply chains optimized to $0.84 per euro would have difficulty performing well when the euro reached $1.60.\\nUncertainty of demand and price drives the value of building flexible production capacity at a plant.\\nIf price and demand do vary over time in a global network, flexible production capacity can be reconfigured to maximize profits in the new environment.\\nBetween 2007 and 2008, auto sales in the United States dropped by more than 30 percent.\\nWhereas all  Table 6-1 Results of Accenture Survey on Sources of Risk That Impact Global Supply Chain Performance  Risk Factors  Percentage of Supply Chains Impacted  Natural disasters

categories were affected, the drop in SUV sales was much more significant than the drop in sales of small cars and hybrids.\\nSUV sales dropped by almost 35 percent, but small car sales actually increased by about 1 percent.\\nHonda dealt with this fluctuation more effectively than its competitors because its plants were flexible enough to produce both vehicle types.\\nThis flexibility to produce both SUVs and cars in the same facility kept Honda plants operating at reasonably high levels of utilization.\\nIn contrast, companies with plants dedicated to SUV production had no option but to leave a lot of idle capacity.\\nIn the late 1990s, Toyota made its global assembly plants more flexible so that each plant could supply multiple markets.\\nOne of the main benefits of this flexibility is that it allows Toyota to react to fluctuations in demand, exchange rates, and local prices by altering production to maximize profits.\\nThus, supply, demand, and financial uncertainty must be considered when making global network design decisions.\\nThis importance of comparative advantage in global supply chains was recognized by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations when he stated, \"If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.\"\\nCost reduction by moving production to low-cost countries is typically mentioned among the top reasons for a supply chain to become global.\\nThe challenge, however, is to quantify the benefits (or comparative advantage) of offshore production along with the reasons for this comparative advantage.\\nWhereas many companies have taken advantage of cost reduction through offshoring, others have found the benefits of offshoring to low-cost countries to be far less than anticipated and in some cases nonexistent.\\nThe increases in transportation costs between 2000 and 2011 have had a significant negative impact on the perceived benefits of offshoring.\\nCompanies have failed to gain from offshoring for two primary reasons--(1) focusing exclusively on unit cost rather than total cost when making the offshoring decision and (2) ignoring critical risk factors.\\nIn this section, we focus on dimensions along which total landed cost needs to be evaluated when making an offshoring decision.\\nThe significant dimensions of total cost can be identified by focusing on the complete sourcing process when offshoring.\\nIt is important to keep in mind that a global supply chain with offshoring increases the length and duration of information, product, and cash flows.\\nAs a result, the complexity and cost of managing the supply chain can be significantly higher than anticipated.\\nTable 6-2 identifies dimensions along which each of the three flows should be analyzed for the impact on cost and product availability.\\nFerreira and Prokopets (2009) suggest that companies should evaluate the impact of off-shoring on the following key elements of total cost: 1.\\nSupplier price: should link to costs from direct materials, direct labor, indirect labor, management, overhead, capital amortization, local taxes, manufacturing costs, and local regulatory compliance costs.\\nTerms: costs are affected by net payment terms and any volume discounts.\\nDelivery costs: include in-country transportation, ocean/air freight, destination transport, and packaging.\\nInventory and warehousing: include in-plant inventories, in-plant handling, plant warehouse costs, supply chain inventories, and supply chain warehousing costs.\\nCost of quality: includes cost of validation, cost of performance drop due to poorer quality, and cost of incremental remedies to combat quality drop.\\nCustomer duties, value added-taxes, local tax incentives 7.\\nCost of risk, procurement staff, broker fees, infrastructure (IT and facilities), and tooling and mold costs.\\nExchange rate trends and their impact on cost.\\nTable 6-2 Dimensions to Consider When Evaluating Total Cost from Offshoring  Performance Dimension Activity Impacting

Labor/fixed costs decrease; quality may suffer Higher freight costs Could go either way Lead time increase results in poorer forecasts and higher inventories Poorer on-time delivery and increased uncertainty resulting in higher inventory and lower product availability Larger minimum quantities increase inventory Increased returns likely Increase Increase Higher hidden costs Increase  It is important to quantify these factors carefully when making the offshoring decision and to track them over time.\\nAs Table 6-2 indicates, unit cost reduction from low labor and fixed costs along with possible tax advantages are likely to be the major benefit from offshoring, with almost every other factor getting worse.\\nIn some instances, the substitution of labor for capital can provide a benefit when offshoring.\\nFor example, auto and auto parts plants in India are designed with much greater labor content than similar manufacturing in developed countries to lower fixed costs.\\nThe benefit of lower labor cost, however, is unlikely to be significant for a manufactured product if labor cost is a small fraction of total cost.\\nIt is also the case that in several low-cost countries such as China and India, labor costs have escalated significantly.\\nAs mentioned by Goel et al.\\n(2008), wage inflation in China averaged 19 percent in dollar terms between 2003 and 2008 compared to around 3 percent in the United States.\\nDuring the same period, transportation costs increased by a significant amount (ocean freight costs increased 135 percent between 2005 and 2008) and the Chinese yuan strengthened relative to the dollar (by about 18 percent between 2005 and 2008).\\nThe net result was that offshoring manufactured products from the United States to China looked much less attractive in 2008 than in 2003.  .\\nIn general, offshoring to low-cost countries is likely to be most attractive for products with high labor content, large production volumes, relatively low variety, and low transportation costs relative to product value.\\nFor example, a company producing a large variety of pumps is likely to find that offshoring the production of castings for a common part across many pumps is likely to be much more attractive than the offshoring of highly specialized engineered parts.\\nGiven that global sourcing tends to increase transportation costs, it is important to focus on reducing transportation content for successful global sourcing.\\nSuitably designed components can facilitate much greater density when transporting products.\\nIKEA has designed modular products that are assembled by the customer.\\nThis allows the modules to be shipped flat in high density, lowering transportation costs.\\nSimilarly, Nissan redesigned its globally sourced components so that they can be packed tighter when shipping.\\nThe use of supplier hubs can be effective if several components are being sourced globally from different locations.\\nMany manufacturers have created supplier hubs in Asia that are fed by each of their Asian suppliers.\\nThis allows for a consolidated shipment to be sent from the hub rather than several smaller shipments from each supplier.\\nMore sophisticated flexible policies that allow for direct shipping from the supplier when volumes are high, coupled with consolidated shipping through a hub when volumes are low, can be effective in lowering transportation content.\\nIt is also important to perform a careful review of the production process to decide which parts are to be offshored.\\nFor example, a small American jewelry manufacturer wanted to offshore manufacturing for a piece of jewelry to Hong Kong.\\nRaw material in the form of gold sheet was sourced in the United States.\\nThe first step in the manufacturing process was the stamping of the gold sheet into a suitable-sized blank.\\nThis process generated about 40 percent waste, which could be recycled to produce more gold sheet.\\nThe manufacturer faced the choice of stamping in the United States or Hong Kong.\\nStamping in Hong Kong would incur lower labor cost but higher transportation cost and would require more working capital because of the delay before the waste gold could be recycled.\\nA careful analysis indicated that it was cheaper for the stamping tools to be installed at the gold sheet supplier in the United States.\\nStamping at the gold sheet supplier reduced transportation cost because only usable material was shipped to Hong Kong.\\nMore importantly, this decision reduced working capital requirement because the waste gold during stamping was recycled within two days.\\nOne of the biggest challenges with offshoring is the increased risk and its potential impact on cost.\\nThis challenge gets exacerbated if a company uses an offshore location that is primarily targeting low costs to absorb all the uncertainties in its supply chain.\\nIn such a context, it is often much more effective to use a combination of an offshore facility that is given predictable, high-volume work along with an onshore or near-shore facility that is specifically designed to handle most of the fluctuation.\\nCompanies solely using an offshore facility often find themselves carrying extra inventory and resorting to air freight because of the long and variable lead times.\\nThe presence of a flexible onshore facility that absorbs all the variation can often lower total landed cost by eliminating expensive outbound freight and significantly reducing the amount of inventory carried in the supply chain.\\nKey Point It is critical that offshoring decisions be made accounting for total cost.\\nOffshoring typically lowers labor and fixed costs but increases risk, freight costs, and working capital.\\nBefore offshoring, product design and process design should be carefully evaluated to identify steps that may lower freight content and the need for working capital.\\nIncluding an onshore option can lower the cost associated with covering risk from an offshore facility.\\nGlobal supply chains today are subject to more risk factors than localized supply chains of the past.\\nThese risks include supply disruption, supply delays, demand fluctuations, price fluctuations, and exchange-rate fluctuations.\\nAs was evident in the financial crisis of 2008, underestimating risks in global supply chains and not having suitable mitigation strategies in place can result in painful outcomes.\\nFor example, contamination at one of the two suppliers of flu vaccine to the United States led to a severe shortage at the beginning of the 2004 flu season.\\nThis shortage led to rationing in most states and severe price gouging in some cases.\\nSimilarly, the significant strengthening of the euro in 2008 hurt firms that had most of their supply sources located in Western Europe.\\nIn another instance, failure to buffer supply uncertainty with sufficient inventory resulted in high costs rather than savings.\\nAn automotive component manufacturer had hoped to save $4 to $5 million a year by sourcing from Asia instead of Mexico.\\nAs a result of port congestion in Los Angeles胎ong Beach, the company had to charter aircraft to fly the parts in from Asia because it did not have sufficient inventory to cover the delays.\\nA charter that would have cost $20,000 per aircraft from Mexico ended up costing the company $750,000.\\nThe anticipated savings turned into a $20 million loss.\\nIt is thus critical for global supply chains to be aware of the relevant risk factors and build in suitable mitigation strategies.\\nTable 6-3 contains a categorization of supply chain risks and their drivers that must be considered during network design.\\nTable 6-3 Supply Chain Risks to

Sodhi, Sloan Management Review (Fall 2004): 53?1.\\nGood network design can play a significant role in mitigating supply chain risk.\\nFor instance, having multiple suppliers mitigates the risk of disruption from any one supply source.\\nAn excellent example is the difference in impact on Nokia and Ericsson when a plant owned by Royal Philips Electronics, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, caught fire in March 2000.\\nNokia adjusted to the disruption quickly, using several other supply plants in its network.\\nIn contrast, Ericsson had no backup source in its network and was unable to react.\\nEricsson estimated that it lost revenues of $400 million as a result.\\nSimilarly, having flexible capacity mitigates the risks of global demand, price, and exchange-rate fluctuations.\\nFor example, Hino Trucks uses flexible capacity at its plants to change production levels for different products by shifting workforce between lines.\\nAs a result, the company keeps a constant workforce in the plant even though the production at each line varies to best match supply and demand.\\nAs illustrated by these examples, designing mitigation strategies into the network significantly improves a supply chain\\'s ability to deal with risk.\\nEvery mitigation strategy, however, comes at a price and may increase other risks.\\nFor example, increasing inventory mitigates the risk of delays but increases the risk of obsolescence.\\nAcquiring multiple suppliers mitigates the risk of disruption but increases costs because each supplier may have difficulty achieving economies of scale.\\nThus, it is important to develop tailored mitigation strategies during network design that achieve a good balance between the amount of risk mitigated and the increase in cost.\\nSome tailored mitigation strategies are outlined in Table 6-4.\\nMost of these strategies are discussed in greater detail later in the book.\\nGlobal supply chains should generally use a combination of mitigation strategies designed into the supply chain along with financial strategies to hedge uncovered risks.\\nA global supply chain strategy focused on efficiency and low cost may concentrate global production in a few low-cost countries.\\nSuch a supply chain design is vulnerable to the risk of supply disruption along with fluctuations in transportation prices and exchange rates.\\nIn such a setting, it is crucial that the firm hedge fuel costs and exchange rates because the supply chain design itself has no built-in mechanisms to deal with these fluctuations.\\nIn contrast, a global supply chain designed with excess, flexible capacity allows production to be shifted to whatever location is most  Table 6-4 Tailored Risk Mitigation Strategies During Network Design  Risk Mitigation Strategy Tailored Strategies  Increase capacity Get redundant suppliers Increase responsiveness Increase inventory Increase flexibility Pool or aggregate demand Increase source capability  Focus on low-cost, decentralized capacity for predictable demand.\\nBuild centralized capacity for unpredictable demand.\\nIncrease decentralization as cost of capacity drops.\\nMore redundant supply for high-volume products, less redundancy for low-volume products.\\nCentralize redundancy for low-volume products in a few flexible suppliers.\\nFavor cost over responsiveness for commodity products.\\nFavor responsiveness over cost for short衍ife cycle products.\\nDecentralize inventory of predictable, lower value products.\\nCentralize inventory of less predictable, higher value products.\\nFavor cost over flexibility for predictable, high-volume products.\\nFavor flexibility for unpredictable, low-volume products.\\nCentralize flexibility in a few locations if it is expensive.\\nIncrease aggregation as unpredictability grows.\\nPrefer capability over cost for high-value, high-risk products.\\nFavor cost over capability for low-value commodity products.\\nCentralize high capability in flexible source if possible.\\nSource: Adapted from \"Managing Risk to Avoid Supply Chain Breakdown.\"\\nSunil Chopra and Manmohan S.

financial hedges.\\nOperational hedges such as flexibility are more complex to execute than financial hedges, but they have the advantage of being reactive because the supply chain can be reconfigured to best react to the macroeconomic state of the world.\\nIt is important to keep in mind that any risk mitigation strategy is not always \"in the money.\"\\nFor example, flexibility built into Honda plants proved effective only when demand for vehicles shifted in an unpredictable manner in 2008.\\nIf there had been no fluctuation in demand, the flexibility would have gone unutilized.\\nFlexibility in the form of the intelligent body assembly system (IBAS) built by Nissan in the early 1990s almost bankrupted the company because the state of the automotive markets was relatively stable at that time.\\nSimilarly, the use of fuel hedges that made billions for Southwest Airlines cost it money toward the end of 2008 when crude oil prices dropped significantly.\\nIt is thus critical that risk mitigation strategies be evaluated rigorously as real options in terms of their expected long-term value before they are implemented.\\nIn the following sections, we discuss methodologies that allow for the financial evaluation of risk mitigation strategies designed into a global supply chain.\\nFlexibility, Chaining, and Containment Flexibility plays an important role in mitigating different risks and uncertainties faced by a global supply chain.\\nFlexibility can be divided into three broad categories--new product flexibility, mix flexibility, and volume flexibility.\\nNew product flexibility refers to a firm\\'s ability to introduce new products into the market at a rapid rate.\\nNew product flexibility is critical in a competitive environment wherein technology is evolving and customer demand is fickle.\\nNew product flexibility may result from the use of common architectures and product platforms with the goal of providing a large number of distinct models using as few unique platforms as possible.\\nThe PC industry has historically followed this approach to introduce a continuous stream of new products.\\nNew product flexibility may also result if a fraction of the production capacity is flexible enough to be able to produce any product.\\nThis approach has been used in the pharmaceutical industry in which a fraction of the capacity is very flexible with all new products first manufactured there.\\nOnly once the product takes off is it moved to a dedicated capacity with lower variable costs.\\nMix flexibility refers to the ability to produce a variety of products within a short period of time.\\nMix flexibility is critical in an environment wherein demand for individual products is small or highly unpredictable, supply of raw materials is uncertain, and technology is evolving rapidly.\\nThe consumer electronics industry is a good example in which mix flexibility is essential in production environments, especially as more production has moved to contract manufacturers.\\nModular design and common components facilitate mix flexibility.\\nZara\\'s European facilities have significant mix flexibility, allowing the company to provide trendy apparel with highly unpredictable demand.\\nVolume flexibility refers to a firm\\'s ability to operate profitably at different levels of output.\\nVolume flexibility is critical in cyclical industries.\\nFirms in the automotive industry that lacked volume flexibility were badly hurt in 2008 when demand for automobiles in the United States shrank significantly.\\nThe steel industry is an example in which some volume flexibility and consolidation have helped performance.\\nPrior to 2000, firms had limited volume flexibility and did not adjust production volumes when demand started to fall.\\nThe result was a buildup of inventories and a significant drop in the price of steel.\\nIn the early 2000s, a few large firms consolidated and developed some volume flexibility.\\nAs a result, they were able to cut production as demand fell.\\nThe result has been less buildup of inventory and smaller drops in price during downturns, followed by a quicker recovery for the steel industry.\\nDedicated Network  Fully Flexible Network  Chained Network with One Long Chain  Chained Network with Two Short Chains  .\\nGiven that some form of flexibility is often used to mitigate risks in global supply chains, it is important to understand the benefits and limitations of this approach.\\nWhen dealing with demand uncertainty, Jordan and Graves (1995) make the important observation that as flexibility is increased, the marginal benefit derived from the increased flexibility decreases.\\nThey suggest operationalizing this idea in the concept of chaining, which is illustrated as follows.\\nConsider a firm that sells four distinct products.\\nA dedicated supply network with no flexibility would have four plants, each dedicated to producing a single product, as shown in Figure 6-1.\\nA fully flexible network configuration would have each plant capable of producing all four products.\\nThe production flexibility of plants is beneficial when demand for each of the four products is unpredictable.\\nWith dedicated plants, the firm is not able to meet demand in excess of plant capacity.\\nWith flexible plants, the firm is able to shift excess demand for a product to a plant with excess capacity.\\nJordan and Graves define a chained network with one long chain (limited flexibility), configured as shown in Figure 6-1.\\nIn a chained configuration, each plant is capable of producing two products with the flexibility organized so that the plants and their products form a chain.\\nJordan and Graves show that a chained network mitigates the risk of demand fluctuation almost as effectively as a fully flexible network.\\nGiven the higher cost of full flexibility, the results of Jordan and Graves indicate that chaining is an excellent strategy to lower cost while gaining most of the benefits of flexibility.\\nThe desired length of chains is an important question to be addressed when designing chained networks.\\nWhen dealing with demand uncertainty, longer chains have the advantage of effectively pooling available capacity to a greater extent.\\nLong chains, however, do have a few disadvantages.\\nThe fixed cost of building a single long chain can be higher than the cost of multiple smaller chains.\\nWith a single long chain, the effect of any fluctuation ripples to all facilities in the chain, making coordination more difficult across the network.\\nIt has also been observed by several researchers that flexibility and chaining are effective when dealing with demand fluctuation but less effective when dealing with supply disruption.\\nIn the presence of supply disruption, Lim et al.\\n(2008) have observed that designing smaller chains that contain or limit the impact of a disruption can be more effective than designing a network with one long chain.\\nAn example of containment is shown in the last example in Figure 6-1, which shows four plants with the flexibility to produce the four products in the form of two short chains.\\nIn this design, any disruption in one of the chains does not impact the other chain.\\nA simple example of containment is hog farming: The farms are large to gain economies of scale, but the hogs are kept separated in small groups to ensure that the risk of disease is contained within a group and does not spread to the entire farm.\\nKey Point Appropriate flexibility is an effective approach for a global supply chain to deal with a variety of risks and uncertainties.\\nWhereas some flexibility is valuable, too much flexibility may not be worth the cost.\\nStrategies like chaining and containment should be used to maximize the benefit from flexibility while keeping costs low.\\nGlobal supply chain design decisions should be evaluated as a sequence of cash flows over the duration of time they will be in place.\\nThis requires the evaluation of future cash flows accounting for risks and uncertainties likely to arise in the global supply chain.\\nIn this section, we discuss the basics of analysis to evaluate future cash flows before introducing uncertainty in the next section.\\nThe present value of a stream of cash flows is what that stream is worth in today\\'s dollars.\\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF) analysis evaluates the present value of any stream of future cash flows and allows management to compare two streams of cash flows in terms of their financial value.\\nDCF analysis is based on the fundamental premise that \"a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow\" because a dollar today may be invested and earn a return in addition to the dollar invested.\\nThis premise provides the basic tool for comparing the relative value of future cash flows that will arrive during different time periods.\\nThe present value of future cash flow is found by using a discount factor.\\nIf a dollar today can be invested and earn a rate of return k over the next period, an investment of $1 today will result in 1  k dollars in the next period.\\nAn investor would therefore be indifferent between obtaining $1 in the next period or $1/(1  k) in the current period.\\nThus, $1 in the next period is discounted by the  discount factor =  1 1+k  .\\nto obtain its present value.\\nThe rate of return k is also referred to as the discount rate, hurdle rate, or opportunity cost  of capital.\\nGiven a stream of cash flows C0, C1, .\\n, CT over the next T periods, and a rate of return k, the net present value (NPV) of this cash flow stream is given by  NPV  =  C0  T +a a t=1  1 1+  k  t b Ct  .\\nThe NPV of different options should be compared when making supply chain decisions.\\nA negative NPV for an option indicates that the option will lose money for the supply chain.\\nThe decision with the highest NPV will provide a supply chain with the highest financial return.\\nEXAMPLE 6-1 Trips Logistics, a third-party logistics firm that provides warehousing and other logistics services, is facing a decision regarding the amount of space to lease for the upcoming three-year period.\\nThe general manager has forecast that Trips Logistics will need to handle a demand of 100,000 units for each of the next three years.\\nHistorically, Trips Logistics has required 1,000 sq.\\nft. of warehouse space for every 1,000 units of demand.\\nFor the purposes of this discussion, the only cost Trips Logistics faces is the cost for the warehouse.\\nTrips Logistics receives revenue of $1.22 for each unit of demand.\\nThe general manager must decide whether to sign a three-year lease or obtain warehousing space on the spot market each year.\\nThe three-year lease will cost $1 per square foot per year, and the spot market rate is expected to be $1.20 per square foot per year for each of the three years.\\nTrips Logistics has a discount rate of k  0.1.\\nAnalysis: The general manager decides to compare the NPV of signing a three-year lease for 100,000 sq.\\nft. of warehouse space with obtaining the space from the spot market each year.\\nIf the general manager obtains warehousing space from the spot market each year, Trips Logistics will earn $1.22 for each  .\\nunit and pay $1.20 for one square foot of warehouse space required.\\nThe expected annual profit for Trips Logistics in this case is given by the following:  Expected annual profit if warehousing = 100,000 * $1.22  space is obtained from spot market  - 100,000 * $1.20 = $2,000.\\nObtaining warehouse space from the spot market provides Trips Logistics with an expected positive cash flow of $2,000 in each of the three years.\\nThe NPV may be evaluated as follows:  NPV1No lease2 = C0 +  C1 1+k  +  C2 11 + k22  = 2,000 +  2,000 1.1  +  2,000 1.12  = $5,471  If the general manager leases 100,000 sq.\\nft. of warehouse space for the next three years, Trips Logistics pays $1 per square foot of space leased each year.\\nThe expected annual profit for Trips Logistics in this case is given by the following:  Expected annual profit with three-year lease = 100,000 * $1.22 - 100,000 * $1.00 = $22,000.\\nSigning a lease for three years provides Trips Logistics with a positive cash flow of $22,000 in each of the three years.\\nThe NPV may be evaluated as  NPV1Lease2 = C0 +  C1 1+k  +  11  C2 + k22  =  22,000  +  22,000 1.1  +  22,000 1.12  = $60,182  The NPV of signing the lease is $60,182  $5,471  $54,711 higher than obtaining warehousing space on the spot market.\\nBased on this simple analysis, a manager may opt to sign the lease.\\nHowever, this does not tell the whole story because we have not yet included the uncertainty in spot prices and valued the greater flexibility to adjust to uncertainty that the spot market provides the manager.\\nIn the next section, we introduce methodology that allows for uncertainty and discuss how the inclusion of uncertainty of future demand and costs may cause the manager to rethink the decision.\\nIn any global supply chain, demand, prices, exchange rates, and several other factors are highly uncertain and are likely to fluctuate during the life of any supply chain decision.\\nIn an uncertain environment, the problem with using a simple DCF analysis is that it typically undervalues flexibility.\\nThe result is often a supply chain that performs well if everything goes according to plan but becomes terribly expensive if something unexpected happens.\\nA manager makes several different decisions when designing a supply chain network.\\nFor instance: ?Should the firm sign a long-term contract for warehousing space or get space from the spot market as needed?\\n?What should the firm\\'s mix of long-term and spot market be in the portfolio of transportation capacity?\\n?How much capacity should various facilities have?\\nWhat fraction of this capacity should be flexible?\\nIf uncertainty is ignored, a manager will always sign long-term contracts (because they are typically cheaper) and avoid all flexible capacity (because it is more expensive).\\nSuch decisions, however, can hurt the firm if future demand or prices are not as forecast at the time of the decision.\\nFor example, until around 1990, all production capacity in the pharmaceutical industry was dedicated.\\nDedicated capacity was cheaper than flexible capacity but could be used only for the drug it was designed for.\\nPharmaceutical companies, however, found it difficult to forecast the demand and price for drugs in the marketplace.\\nThus, a large fraction of the dedicated capacity could go unused if the forecast demand did not materialize.\\nToday, pharmaceutical companies have a strategy of carrying a portfolio of dedicated and flexible capacity.\\nMost products are introduced in a flexible facility and are moved to a dedicated facility only when a reasonably accurate forecast of future demand is available.\\nDuring network design, managers thus need a methodology that allows them to estimate the uncertainty in their forecast of demand and price and then incorporate this uncertainty in the decision-making process.\\nSuch a methodology is most important for network design decisions because these decisions are hard to change in the short term.\\nIn this section, we describe such a methodology and show that accounting for uncertainty can have a significant impact on the value of network design decisions.\\nThe Basics of Decision Tree Analysis A decision tree is a graphic device used to evaluate decisions under uncertainty.\\nDecision trees with DCFs can be used to evaluate supply chain design decisions given uncertainty in prices, demand, exchange rates, and inflation.\\nThe first step in setting up a decision tree is to identify the number of time periods into the future that will be considered when making the decision.\\nThe decision maker should also identify the duration of a period--which could be a day, a month, a quarter, or any other time period.\\nThe duration of a period should be the minimum period of time over which factors affecting supply chain decisions may change by a significant amount.\\n\"Significant\" is hard to define, but in most cases it is appropriate to use as a period the duration over which an aggregate plan holds.\\nIf planning is done monthly, we set the duration of a period at a month.\\nIn the following discussion, T will represent the number of time periods over which the supply chain decision is to be evaluated.\\nThe next step is to identify factors that will affect the value of the decision and are likely to fluctuate over the next T periods.\\nThese factors include demand, price, exchange rate, and inflation, among others.\\nHaving identified the key factors, the next step is to identify probability distributions that define the fluctuation of each factor from one period to the next.\\nIf, for instance, demand and price are identified as the two key factors that affect the decision, the probability of moving from a given value of demand and price in one period to any other value of demand and price in the next period must be defined.\\nThe next step is to identify a periodic discount rate k to be applied to future cash flows.\\nIt is not essential that the same discount rate apply to each period or even at every node in a period.\\nThe discount rate should take into account the inherent risk associated with the investment.\\nIn general, a higher discount rate should apply to investments with higher risk.\\nThe decision is now evaluated using a decision tree, which contains the present and T future periods.\\nWithin each period, a node must be defined for every possible combination of factor values (say, demand and price) that can be achieved.\\nArrows are drawn from origin nodes in Period i to end nodes in Period i  1.\\nThe probability on an arrow is referred to as the transition probability and is the probability of transitioning from the origin node in Period i to the end node in Period i  1.\\nThe decision tree is evaluated starting from nodes in Period T and working back to Period 0.\\nFor each node, the decision is optimized taking into account current and future values of various factors.\\nThe analysis is based on Bellman\\'s principle, which states that for any choice of strategy in a given state, the optimal strategy in the next period is the one that is selected if the entire analysis is assumed to begin in the next period.\\nThis principle allows the optimal strategy to be solved in a backward fashion starting at the last period.\\nExpected future cash flows are discounted back and included in the decision currently under consideration.\\nnode in Period 0 gives the value of the investment as well as the decisions made during each time period.\\nTools such as Treeplan are available that help solve decision trees on spreadsheets.\\nThe decision tree analysis methodology is summarized as follows: 1.\\nIdentify the duration of each period (month, quarter, etc.)\\nand the number of periods T over which the decision is to be evaluated.\\nIdentify factors such as demand, price, and exchange rate whose fluctuation will be considered over the next T periods.\\nIdentify representations of uncertainty for each factor; that is, determine what distribution to use to model the uncertainty.\\nIdentify the periodic discount rate k for each period.\\nRepresent the decision tree with defined states in each period as well as the transition probabilities between states in successive periods.\\nStarting at period T, work back to Period 0, identifying the optimal decision and the expected cash flows at each step.\\nExpected cash flows at each state in a given period should be discounted back when included in the previous period.\\nEvaluating Flexibility at Trips Logistics We illustrate the decision tree analysis methodology by using the lease decision facing the general manager at Trips Logistics.\\nThe manager must decide whether to lease warehouse space for the coming three years and the quantity to lease.\\nThe long-term lease is currently cheaper than the spot market rate for warehouse space.\\nThe manager anticipates uncertainty in demand and spot prices for warehouse space over the coming three years.\\nThe long-term lease is cheaper but could go unused if demand is lower than anticipated.\\nThe long-term lease may also end up being more expensive if future spot market prices come down.\\nIn contrast, spot market rates are high and warehouse space from the spot market will be expensive if future demand is high.\\nThe manager is considering three options: 1.\\nGet all warehousing space from the spot market as needed.\\nSign a three-year lease for a fixed amount of warehouse space and get additional requirements from the spot market.\\nSign a flexible lease with a minimum charge that allows variable usage of warehouse space up to a limit with additional requirement from the spot market.\\nWe now discuss how the manager can make the appropriate decision, taking uncertainty into account.\\nOne thousand square feet of warehouse space is required for every 1,000 units of demand, and the current demand at Trips Logistics is for 100,000 units per year.\\nThe manager forecasts that from one year to the next, demand may go up by 20 percent with a probability of 0.5 or go down by 20 percent with a probability of 0.5.\\nThe probabilities of the two outcomes are independent and unchanged from one year to the next.\\nThe general manager can sign a three-year lease at a price of $1 per square foot per year.\\nWarehouse space is currently available on the spot market for $1.20 per square foot per year.\\nFrom one year to the next, spot prices for warehouse space may go up by 10 percent with probability 0.5 or go down by 10 percent with probability 0.5, according to a binomial process.\\nThe probabilities of the two outcomes are independent and unchanged from one year to the next.\\nThe general manager believes that prices of warehouse space and demand for the product fluctuate independently.\\nEach unit Trips Logistics handles results in revenue of $1.22, and Trips Logistics is committed to handling all demand that arises.\\nTrips Logistics uses a discount rate of k  0.1 for each of the three years.\\nThe general manager assumes that all costs are incurred at the beginning of each year and thus constructs a decision tree with T  2.\\nThe decision tree is shown in Figure 6-2, with each node representing demand (D) in thousands of units and price (p) in dollars.\\nThe probability of each transition is 0.25 because price and demand fluctuate independently.\\nPeriod 1  Period 2  D = 100 p = $1.20  D = 120 p = $1.32 0.25 0.25 D =

$1.45  D = 64 p = $1.19  D = 64 p = $0.97 .\\nEvaluating the Spot Market Option The manager first analyzes the option of not signing a lease and obtaining all warehouse space from the spot market.\\nHe starts with Period 2 and evaluates the profit for Trips Logistics at each node.\\nAt the node D  144, p  $1.45, Trips Logistics must satisfy a demand of 144,000 and faces a spot price of $1.45 per square foot for warehouse space in Period 2.\\nThe cost incurred by Trips Logistics in Period 2 at the node D  144, p  $1.45 is represented by C(D  144, p 1.45, 2) and is given by C1D = 144, p = 1.45, 22 = 144,000 * 1.45 = $208,800 The profit at Trips Logistics in Period 2 at the node D  144, p  $1.45 is represented by P(D  144, p  1.45, 2) and is given by P1D = 144, p = $1.45, 22 = 144,000 * 1.22 - C1D = 144, p = 1.45, 22 = 175,680 - 208,800 = - $33,120  .\\nTable 6-5 Period 2 Calculations for Spot Market Option  Revenue  Cost C(D , p , 2)  Profit P(D , p , 2)  D  144, p  1.45 D

profit at each node in Period 1 to be the profit during Period 1 plus the present value (in Period 1) of the expected profit in Period 2.\\nThe expected profit EP(D , p , 1) at a node is the expected profit over all four nodes in Period 2 that may result from this node.\\nPVEP(D , p , 1) represents the present value of this expected profit; P(D , p , 1), the total expected profit, is the sum of the profit in Period 1 and the present value of the expected profit in Period 2.\\nFrom the node D  120, p  $1.32 in Period 1, there are four possible states in Period 2.\\nThe manager thus evaluates the expected profit in Period 2 over all four states possible from the node D  120, p  $1.32 in Period 1 to be EP(D  120, p  1.32, 1), where EP1D = 120, p = 1.32, 12 = 0.25 * 3P1D = 144, p = 1.45, 22

the sum of the profit in Period 1 at this node and the present value of future expected profits.\\nP1D = 120, p = 1.32, 12 = 120,000 * 1.22 - 120,000 * 1.32 + PVEP1D = 120, p = 1.32, 12 = - $12,000 - $10,909 = -$22,909 The total expected profit for all other nodes in Period 1 is evaluated as shown in Table 6-6.\\nFor Period 0, the total profit P(D  100, p  1.20, 0) is the sum of the profit at Period 0 and the present value of the expected profit over the four nodes in Period 1.\\nEP1D = 100, p = 1.20, 02 = 0.25 * 3P1D = 120, p = 1.32, 12 + P1D = 120, p = 1.08, 12 + P1D = 96, p = 1.32, 12 +

warehousing space from the spot market is given by NPV1Spot Market2 = $5,471 Evaluating the Fixed Lease Option The manager next evaluates the alternative whereby the lease for 100,000 sq.\\nft. of warehouse space is signed.\\nThe evaluation procedure is very similar to that for the previous case, but the outcome in terms of profit changes.\\nFor example, at the node D  144, p  1.45, the manager will require 44,000 sq.\\nft. of warehouse space from the spot market at $1.45 per square foot because only 100,000 sq.\\nft. have been leased at $1 per square foot.\\nIf demand happens to be less than 100,000 units, Trips Logistics still has to pay for the entire 100,000 sq.\\nFor Period 2, the manager obtains the profit at each of the nine nodes as shown in Table 6-7.\\nThe manager next evaluates the total expected profit for each node in Period 1.\\nAgain, the expected profit EP(D , p , 1) at a node is the expected profit of all four nodes in Period 2 that  Table 6-7 Period 2 Profit

1,000,000 - 100,000 * 40 = 2,000,000 Period 1 profits = 112,000 * 70 - 1,000,000 - 112,000 * 40 = 2,360,000 Period 2 profits = 125,440 * 70 - 1,000,000 - 125,440 * 40 =  2,763,200  Table 6-13 Expected Future Demand and Exchange Rate  Period 1  Period 2  Demand  Exchange Rate  Demand  Exchange Rate  112,000  8.64 yuan/ euro  125,440  8.2944 yuan /euro  .\\nThus, the DCF for the onshoring option is obtained as follows: Expected profit from onshoring = 2,000,000 + 2,360,000/1.1 + 2,763,200/1.21 = 6,429,091 For the off-shoring option we have the following: Period 0 profits = 100,000 * 70 - 8,000,000/9 - 100,000 * 340/9 = 2,333,333 Period 1 profits = 112,000 * 70 - 8,000,000/8.64 - 112,000 * 340/8.64 = 2,506,667 Period 2 profits = 125,440 * 70 - 8,000,000/7.9524 - 125,440 * 340/7.9524 = 2,674,319 Thus, the DCF for the off-shoring option is obtained as follows: Expected profit from off-shoring = 2,333,333 + 2,506,667/1.1 + 2,674,319/1.21 = 6,822,302 Based on performing a simple DCF analysis and assuming the expected trend of demand and exchange rates over the next two periods, it seems that offshoring should be preferred to onshoring because it is expected to provide additional profits of almost 393,000.\\nThe problem with the above analysis is that it has ignored uncertainty.\\nFor example, even though the demand is expected to grow, there is some probability that it will decrease.\\nIf demand drops below 100,000 panels, the offshore option could end up costing more because of the lack of flexibility.\\nSimilarly, if demand increases more than expected (grows by 20 percent in each of the two years), the offshore facility will not be able to keep up with the increase.\\nAn accurate analysis must reflect the uncertainties and should ideally be performed using a decision tree.\\nEvaluating the Options Using Decision Trees For this analysis we construct a decision tree as shown in Figure 6-3.\\nEach node in a given period leads to four possible nodes in the next period because demand and the exchange rate may go up or down.\\nThe detailed links and transition probabilities are shown in Figure 6-3.\\nDemand is in thousands and is represented by D. The exchange rate is represented by E, where E is the number of yuan to a euro.\\nFor example, starting with the node D  100, E  9.00 in Period 0, one can transition to any of four nodes in Period 1.\\nThe transition to the node D  120, E  9.90 in Period 1 occurs if demand increases (probability of 0.8) and the yuan weakens (probability of 0.3).\\nThus, the transition from node D  100, E  9.00 in Period 0 to node D  120, E  9.90 in Period 1 occurs with probability 0.8 ?0.3  0.24.\\nAll other transition probabilities in Figure 6-3 are calculated in a similar manner.\\nThe main advantage of using a decision tree is that it allows for the true evaluation of profits in each scenario that D-Solar may find itself.\\nEvaluating the Onshore Option Recall that the onshore option is flexible and can change production levels (and thus variable costs) to match demand levels between 60,000 and 150,000.\\nIn the following analysis, we calculate the expected profits at each node in the decision tree (represented by the corresponding values of D and E) starting in Period 2 and working back to the present (Period 0).\\nWith the onshore option, exchange rates do not affect profits in euro because both revenue and costs are in euro.\\nPERIOD 2 EVALUATION We provide a detailed analysis for the node D  144 (solar panel demand of 144,000), E  10.89 (exchange rate of 10.89 yuan per euro).\\nGiven its flexibility, the onshore facility is able to produce the entire demand of 144,000 panels at  .\\nPeriod 1  Period 2  D = 100 E = 9.00  0.8 ?0.3 0.8 ?0.3  0.2 ?0.7 0.2 ?0.7  0.8 ?0.7 0.2 ?0.3  0.8 ?0.3  D = 144 E = 10.89  0.8 ?0.7  D = 144 E = 8.91  D = 120 E = 9.90 D = 120 E = 8.10 D = 80 E = 9.90 D = 80 E = 8.10  0.2 ?0.3  D = 96  0.8 ?0.3 0.2 ?0.3  0.2  0.8 ?0.3 ?0.7  E = 10.89 D = 96 E = 8.91  0.8  ?\\n0.7  D = 144  0.2 ?0.7  E = 7.29  D = 96  0.8 ?0.7  E = 7.29  0.2 ?0.3  0.2 ?0.3  D = 64 E = 10.89  0.2 ?0.7  D = 64 E = 8.91 D = 64 E = 7.29  .\\na variable cost of 40 and sell each panel for revenue of 70.\\nRevenues and costs are evaluated as follows: Revenue from the manufacture and sale of 144,000 panels = 144,000 * 70 = 10,080,000 Fixed + variable cost of onshore plant = 1,000,000 + 144,000 * 40 = 6,760,000 In Period 2, the total profit for D-Solar at the node D  144, E  10.89 for the onshore option is thus given by P1D = 144, E = 10.89, 22 = 10,080,000 - 6,760,000 = 3,320,000 Using the same approach, we can evaluate the profit in each of the nine states (represented by the corresponding value of D and E) in Period 2 as shown in Table 6-14.  .\\nTable 6-14 Period 2 Profits for Onshore Option  Production D E Sales Cost Quantity Revenue (euro)  144 10.89 144,000 144 8.91 144,000 96 10.89 96,000 96 8.91 96,000 144 7.29 144,000 96 7.29 96,000 64 10.89 64,000 64 8.91 64,000 64 7.29 64,000  144,000 144,000 96,000 96,000 144,000 96,000 64,000 64,000 64,000  10,080,000 10,080,000 6,720,000 6,720,000 10,080,000 6,720,000 4,480,000 4,480,000 4,480,000  Cost (euro) 6,760,000 6,760,000 4,840,000 4,840,000 6,760,000 4,840,000 3,560,000 3,560,000 3,560,000  Profit (euro) 3,320,000 3,320,000 1,880,000 1,880,000 3,320,000 1,880,000 920,000 920,000 920,000  PERIOD 1 EVALUATION Period 1 contains four outcome nodes to be analyzed.\\nA detailed analysis for one of the nodes, D  120, E  9.90, is presented here.\\nIn addition to the revenue and cost at this node, we also need to consider the present value of the expected profit in Period 2 from the four nodes that may result.\\nThe transition probability into each of the four nodes is as shown in Figure 6-3.\\nThe expected profit in Period 2 for the four potential outcomes resulting from the node D  120, E  9.90 is thus given by EP(D = 120, E = 9.90, 1) = 0.24 * P(D = 144, E = 10.89, 2) + 0.56 * P(D = 144, E = 8.91, 2) + 0.06 * P(D = 96, E = 10.89, 2) + 0.14 * P(D = 96, E = 8.91, 2) = 0.24 * 3,320,000 + 0.56 * 3,320,000 + 0.06 * 1,880,000 + 0.14 * 1,880,000 = 3,032,000 The present value of the expected profit in Period 2 discounted to Period 1 is given by PVEP1D = 120, E = 9.90, 12 = EP1D = 120, E = 9.90, 12>11 + k2 = 3,032,000/1.1 = 2,756,364 Next we evaluate the profits at the onshore plant at the node D  120, E  9.90 from its operations in Period 1, in which the onshore plant produces 120,000 panels at a variable cost of 40 and obtains revenue of 70 per panel.\\nRevenues and costs are evaluated as follows: Revenue from manufacture and sale of 120,000 panels = 120,000 * 70 =  8,400,000 Fixed + variable cost of onshore plant = 1,000,000 + 120,000 * 40 = 5,800,000 The expected profit for D-Solar at the node D  120, E  9.90 is obtained by adding the operational profits at this node in Period 1 and the discounted expected profits from the four nodes that may result in Period 2.\\nThe expected profit at this node in Period 1 is given by P1D = 120, E = 9.90, 12 = 8,400,000 - 5,800,000 + PVEP(D = 120, E = 9.90, 1) = 2,600,000 + 2,756,364 = 5,356,364 The expected profits for all nodes in Period 1 are calculated similarly and shown in Table 6-15.  .\\nTable 6-15 Period 1 Profits for Onshore Option  Production Revenue  Cost  D E Sales Cost Quantity (euro) (euro)  120 9.90 120 8.10 80 9.90 80 8.10  120,000 120,000 80,000 80,000  120,000 120,000 80,000 80,000  8,400,000 8,400,000 5,600,000 5,600,000  5,800,000 5,800,000 4,200,000 4,200,000  Expected Profit (euro) 5,356,364 5,356,364 2,934,545 2,934,545  PERIOD 0 EVALUATION In Period 0, the demand and exchange rate are given by D  100, E  9.\\nIn addition to the revenue and cost at this node, we also need to consider the discounted expected profit from the four nodes in Period 1.\\nThe expected profit is given by EP(D = 100, E = 9.00, 0) = 0.24 * P(D = 120, E = 9.90, 1) + 0.56 * P(D = 120, E = 8.10, 1) + 0.06 * P(D = 80, E = 9.90, 1) + 0.14 * P(D = 80, E = 8.10, 1) = 0.24 * 5,356,364 + 0.56 * 5,5356,364 + 0.06 * 2,934,545 + 0.14 * 2,934,545 =  4,872,000 The present value of the expected profit in Period 1 discounted to Period 0 is given by PVEP1D = 100, E = 9.00, 02 = EP1D = 100, E = 9.00, 02>11 + k2 = 4,872,000/1.1 = 4,429,091 Next we evaluate the profits from the onshore plant\\'s operations in Period 0 from the manufacture and sale of 100,000 panels.\\nRevenue from manufacture and sale of 100,000 panels = 100,000 * 70 =  7,000,000 Fixed + variable cost of onshore plant = 1,000,000 + 100,000 * 40 = 5,000,000 The expected profit for D-Solar at the node D  100, E  9.00 in Period 0 is given by P1D = 100, E = 9.00, 02 = 7,000,000 - 5,000,000 + PVEP(D = 100, E = 9.00,0) = 2,000,000 + 4,429,091 =  6,429,091 Thus, building the onshore plant has an expected payoff of 6,429,091 over the evaluation period.\\nThis number accounts for uncertainties in demand and exchange rates and the ability of the onshore facility to react to these fluctuations.\\nEvaluating the Offshore Option As with the onshore option, we start by evaluating profits at each node in Period 2 and then back our evaluation to Periods 1 and 0.\\nEach node is represented by the corresponding values of D and E. Recall that the offshore option is not fully flexible and can change production levels (and thus variable costs) only between 100,000 and 130,000 panels.\\nThus, if demand falls below 100,000 panels, D-Solar still incurs the variable production cost of 100,000 panels.\\nIf demand increases above 130,000 panels, the offshore facility can meet demand only up to 130,000 panels.\\nAt each node, given the demand, we calculate the expected profits accounting for the exchange rate that influences offshore costs evaluated in euro.\\nPERIOD 2 EVALUATION The detailed analysis for the node D  144 (solar panel demand of 144,000), E  10.89 (exchange rate of 10.89 yuan per euro) is as follows.\\nEven though demand is for 144,000 panels, given its lack of volume flexibility, the offshore facility is able to produce only 130,000 panels at a variable cost of 340 yuan each and sell each panel for revenue of 70.\\nRevenues and costs are evaluated as follows: Revenue from manufacture and sale of 130,000 panels = 130,000 * 70 =  9,100,000 Fixed + variable cost of offshore plant = 8,000,000 + 130,000 * 340 = 52,200,000 yuan The total profit for D-Solar at the node D  144, E  10.89 for the offshore option (evaluated in euro), is thus given by P1D = 144, E = 10.89, 22 = 9,100,000 - 152,200,00>10.892 =  4,306,612 Using the same approach, we can evaluate the profit in each of the nine states (represented by the corresponding values of D and E) in Period 2 as shown in Table 6-16.\\nObserve that the lack of flexibility at the offshore facility hurts D-Solar whenever demand is above 130,000 (lost margin) or below 100,000 (higher costs).\\nFor example, when the demand drops to 64,000 panels, the offshore facility continues to incur variable production costs for 100,000 panels.\\nProfits are also hurt when the yuan is stronger than expected.\\nPERIOD 1 EVALUATION In Period 1, there are four outcome nodes to be analyzed.\\nAs with the onshore option, a detailed analysis for one of the nodes D  120, E  9.90 is presented here.\\nIn addition to the revenue and cost from operations at this node, we also need to consider the present value of the expected profit in Period 2 from the four nodes that may result.\\nThe transition probability into each of the four nodes is as shown in Figure 6-3.\\nThe expected profit in Period 2 from the node D  120, E  9.90 is thus given by EP(D = 120, E = 9.90,1) = 0.24 * P(D = 144, E = 10.89, 2) + 0.56 * P(D = 144, E = 8.91, 2) + 0.06 * P(D = 96, E = 10.89, 2) + 0.14 * P(D = 96, E = 8.91, 2) = 0.24 * 4,306,612 + 0.56 * 3,241,414 + 0.06 * 2,863,251

panels at a variable cost of 340 yuan and obtains revenue of 70 per panel.\\nRevenues and costs are evaluated as follows: Revenue from manufacture and sale of 120,000 panels = 120,000 * 70 =  8,400,000 Fixed + variable cost of onshore plant = 8,000,000 + 120,000 * 340 = 48,800,000 yuan The expected profit for D-Solar at the node D  120, E  9.90 in Period 1 is given by P1D = 120, E = 9.90, 12 = 8,400,000 - 148,800,00>9.902 + PVEP(D = 120, E = 9.90, 1) = 3,470,707 + 3,001,310 = 6,472,017 For the offshore option, the expected profits for all nodes in Period 1 are shown in Table 6-17.\\nObserve that for the node D  80, E  8.10, D-Solar has a lower expected profit from the offshore option (Table 6-17) relative to the onshore option (see Table 6-15) because the offshore plant incurs high variable cost given its lack of flexibility (cost is incurred for 100,000 units even though only 80,000 are sold), and all offshore costs become expensive given the strong yuan.\\nPERIOD 0 EVALUATION In Period 0, the demand and exchange rate are given by D  100, E  9.\\nIn addition to the revenue and cost at this node, we also need to consider the present value of expected profit from the four nodes in Period 1.\\nThe expected profit for the offshore option is given by EP(D = 100, E = 9.00, 0) = 0.24 * P(D = 120, E = 9.90, 1) + 0.56 * P(D = 120, E = 8.10, 1) + 0.06 * P(D = 80, E =

panels.\\nRevenue from manufacture and sale of 100,000 panels = 100,000 * 70 =  7,000,000 Fixed + variable cost of offshore plant = 8,000,000 + 100,000 * 340 = 42,000,000 yuan The expected profit for D-Solar at the node D  100, E  9.00 in Period 0 is given by P1D = 100, E = 9.00, 02 = 7,000,000 - (42,000,00>9.002 + PVEP(D = 100, E = 9.00, 0) = 2,333,333 + 3,914,164 =  6,247,497 Thus, building the offshore plant has an expected payoff of 6,247,497 over the evaluation period.\\nObserve that the use of a decision tree that accounts for both demand and exchange rate fluctuation shows that the onshore option and its flexibility is in fact more valuable (worth 6,429,091) than the offshore facility (worth 6,247,497), which is less flexible.\\nThis is in direct contrast to the decision that would have resulted if we had simply used the expected change in demand and exchange rate from one year to the next.\\nWhen using the expected change in demand, the onshore option provided expected profits of 6,429,091, while the offshore option provided expected profits of 6,822,302.\\nThe offshore option is overvalued in this case because the potential fluctuations in demand and exchange rates are wider than the expected fluctuations.\\nUsing the expected fluctuation thus does not fully account for the lack of flexibility in the offshore facility and the big increase in costs that may result if the yuan strengthens more than the expected value.\\nDe Traville and Trigeorgis (2010) discuss the importance of evaluating all global supply chain design decisions using the decision tree or real options methodology.\\nThey give the example of Flexcell, a Swiss company that offered lightweight solar panels.\\nIn 2006, the company was looking to expand its operations by building a new plant.\\nThe three locations under discussion were China, eastern Germany, and near the company headquarters in Switzerland.\\nEven though the Chinese and eastern German plants were cheaper than the Swiss plant, Flexcell management justified building the high-cost Swiss plant because of its higher flexibility and ability to react to changing market conditions.\\nIf only the expected values of future scenarios had been used, the more expensive Swiss plant could not be justified.\\nThis decision paid off for the company because the Swiss plant was flexible enough to handle the considerable variability in demand that resulted during the downturn in 2008.\\nWhen underlying decision trees are complex and explicit solutions for the underlying decision tree are difficult to obtain, firms should use simulation for evaluating decisions (see Chapter 13).\\nIn a complex decision tree, thousands or even millions of possible paths may arise from the first period to the last.\\nTransition probabilities are used to generate probabilityweighted random paths within the decision tree.\\nFor each path, the stage-by-stage decision and the present value of the payoff are evaluated.\\nThe paths are generated in such a way that the probability of a path being generated during the simulation is the same as the probability of the path in the decision tree.\\nAfter generating many paths and evaluating the payoffs in each case, the payoffs obtained during the simulation are used as a representation of the payoffs that would result from the decision tree.\\nThe expected payoff is then found by averaging the payoffs obtained in the simulation.\\nSimulation methods are very good at evaluating a decision when the path itself is not decision dependent--in other words, when transition probabilities from one period to the next are not dependent on the decision taken during a period.\\nThey can also take into account real-world constraints as well as complex decision rules.\\nIn addition, they can easily handle different forms of uncertainty even when uncertainty between different factors is correlated.\\nSimulation models require a higher setup cost to start and operate compared to decision tree tools.\\nHowever, their main advantage is that they can provide high-quality evaluations of complex situations.\\nManagers should consider the following ideas to help them make better network design decisions under uncertainty.\\nCombine strategic planning and financial planning during global network design.\\nIn most organizations, financial planning and strategic planning are performed independently.\\nStrategic planning tries to prepare for future uncertainties but often without rigorous quantitative analysis, whereas financial planning performs quantitative analysis but assumes a predictable or well-defined future.\\nThis chapter presents methodologies that allow integration of financial and strategic planning.\\nDecision makers should design global supply chain networks considering a portfolio of strategic options--the option to wait, build excess capacity, build flexible capacity, sign long-term contracts, purchase from the spot market, and so forth.\\nThe various options should be evaluated in the context of future uncertainty.\\nUse multiple metrics to evaluate global supply chain networks.\\nAs one metric can give only part of the picture, it is beneficial to examine network design decisions using multiple metrics such as firm profits, supply chain profits, customer service levels, and response times.\\nGood decisions perform well along most relevant metrics.\\nUse financial analysis as an input to decision making, not as the decision-making process.\\nFinancial analysis is a great tool in the decision-making process, as it often produces an answer and an abundance of quantitative data to back up that answer.\\nHowever, financial methodologies alone do not provide a complete picture of the alternatives, and other nonquantifiable inputs should also be considered.\\nUse estimates along with sensitivity analysis.\\nMany of the inputs into financial analysis are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain accurately.\\nThis can cause financial analysis to be a long and drawn-out process.\\nOne of the best ways to speed the process along and arrive at a good decision is to use estimates of inputs when it appears that finding an accurate input would take an inordinate amount of time.\\nAs we discuss in some of the other practice-oriented sections, using estimates is fine when the estimates are backed up by sensitivity analysis.\\nIt is almost always easier to come up with a range for an input than it is to come up with a single point.\\nBy performing sensitivity analysis on the input\\'s range, managers can often show that no matter where the true input lies within the range, the decision remains the same.\\nWhen this is not the case, they have highlighted a key variable to making the decision and it likely deserves more attention to arrive at a more accurate answer.\\nIn summary, to make supply chain design decisions effectively, managers need to make estimates of inputs and then test all recommendations with sensitivity analysis.\\nIdentify factors that need to be included in total cost when making global sourcing decisions.\\nBesides unit cost, total cost should include the impact of global sourcing on freight, inventories, lead time, quality, on-time delivery, minimum order quantity, working capital, and stockouts.\\nOther factors to be considered include the impact on supply chain visibility, order communication, invoicing errors, and the need for currency hedging.\\nDefine uncertainties that are particularly relevant when designing global supply chains.\\nThe performance of a global supply chain is impacted by uncertainty in a number of input factors such as demand, price, exchange rates, and other economic factors.\\nThese uncertainties  .\\nand any flexibility in the supply chain network must be taken into account when evaluating alternative designs of a supply chain.\\nExplain different strategies that may be used to mitigate risk in global supply chains.\\nOperational strategies that help mitigate risk in global supply chains include carrying excess capacity and inventory, flexible capacity, redundant suppliers, improved responsiveness, and aggregation of demand.\\nHedging fuel costs and currencies are financial strategies that can help mitigate risk.\\nIt is important to keep in mind that no risk mitigation strategy will always pay off.\\nThese mitigation strategies are designed to guard against certain extreme states of the world that may arise in an uncertain global environment.\\nUnderstand decision tree methodologies used to evaluate supply chain design decisions under uncertainty.\\nWhen valuing the streams of cash flows resulting from the performance of a supply chain, decision trees are a basic approach to valuing alternatives under uncertainty.\\nUncertainty along different dimensions over the evaluation period is represented as a tree with each node corresponding to a possible scenario.\\nStarting at the last period of the evaluation interval, the decision tree analysis works back to Period 0, identifying the optimal decision and the expected cash flows at each step.\\n Understand the role of forecasting for both an enterprise and a supply chain.\\nIdentify the components of a demand forecast.\\nForecast demand in a supply chain given historical demand data using time-series methodologies.\\nAnalyze demand forecasts to estimate forecast error.\\nAll supply chain decisions made before demand has materialized are made to a forecast.\\nIn this chapter, we explain how historical demand information can be used to forecast future demand and how these forecasts affect the supply chain.\\nWe describe several methods to forecast demand and estimate a forecast\\'s accuracy.\\nWe then discuss how these methods can be implemented using Microsoft Excel.\\nDemand forecasts form the basis of all supply chain planning.\\nConsider the push/pull view of the supply chain discussed in Chapter 1.\\nAll push processes in the supply chain are performed in anticipation of customer demand, whereas all pull processes are performed in response to customer demand.\\nFor push processes, a manager must plan the level of activity, be it production, transportation, or any other planned activity.\\nFor pull processes, a manager must plan the level of available capacity and inventory but not the actual amount to be executed.\\nIn both instances, the first step a manager must take is to forecast what customer demand will be.\\nA Home Depot store selling paint orders the base paint and dyes in anticipation of customer orders, whereas it performs final mixing of the paint in response to customer orders.\\nHome Depot uses a forecast of future demand to determine the quantity of paint and dye to have on hand (a push process).\\nFarther up the supply chain, the paint factory that produces the base also needs forecasts to determine its own production and inventory levels.\\nThe paint factory\\'s suppliers also need forecasts for the same reason.\\nWhen each stage in the supply chain makes its own separate forecast, these forecasts are often very different.\\nThe result is a mismatch between supply and demand.\\nWhen all stages of a supply chain work together to produce a collaborative forecast, it tends to be much more accurate.\\nThe resulting forecast accuracy enables supply chains to be both more responsive and more efficient in serving their customers.\\nLeaders in many supply chains, from PC manufacturers to packaged-goods retailers, have improved their ability to match supply and demand by moving toward collaborative forecasting.\\nConsider the value of collaborative forecasting for Coca-Cola and its bottlers.\\nCoca-Cola decides on the timing of various promotions based on the demand forecast over the coming quarter.\\nPromotion decisions are then incorporated into an updated demand forecast.\\nThe updated forecast is essential for the bottlers to plan their capacity and production decisions.\\nA bottler operating without an updated forecast based on the promotion is unlikely to have sufficient supply available for Coca-Cola, thus hurting supply chain profits.\\nMature products with stable demand, such as milk or paper towels, are usually easiest to forecast.\\nForecasting and the accompanying managerial decisions are extremely difficult when either the supply of raw materials or the demand for the finished product is highly unpredictable.\\nFashion goods and many high-tech products are examples of items that are difficult to forecast.\\nIn both instances, an estimate of forecast error is essential when designing the supply chain and planning its response.\\nBefore we begin an in-depth discussion of the components of forecasts and forecasting methods in the supply chain, we briefly list characteristics of forecasts that a manager must understand to design and manage his or her supply chain effectively.\\nCompanies and supply chain managers should be aware of the following characteristics of forecasts.\\nForecasts are always inaccurate and should thus include both the expected value of the forecast and a measure of forecast error.\\nTo understand the importance of forecast error, consider two car dealers.\\nOne of them expects sales to range between 100 and 1,900 units, whereas the other expects sales to range between 900 and 1,100 units.\\nEven though both dealers anticipate average sales of 1,000, the sourcing policies for each dealer should be very different given the difference in forecast accuracy.\\nThus, the forecast error (or demand uncertainty) must be a key input into most supply chain decisions.\\nUnfortunately, most firms do not maintain any estimate of forecast error.\\nLong-term forecasts are usually less accurate than short-term forecasts; that is, long-term forecasts have a larger standard deviation of error relative to the mean than short-term forecasts.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan has exploited this key property to improve its performance.\\nThe company has instituted a replenishment process that enables it to respond to an order within hours.\\nFor example, if a store manager places an order by 10 A.M., the order is delivered by 7 P.M. the same day.\\nTherefore, the manager only has to forecast what will sell that night less than 12 hours before the actual sale.\\nThe short lead time allows a manager to take into account current information that could affect product sales, such as the weather.\\nThis forecast is likely to be more accurate than if the store manager had to forecast demand one week in advance.\\nAggregate forecasts are usually more accurate than disaggregate forecasts, as they tend to have a smaller standard deviation of error relative to the mean.\\nFor example, it is easy to forecast the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States for a given year with less than a 2 percent error.\\nHowever, it is much more difficult to forecast yearly revenue for a company with less than a 2 percent error, and it is even harder to forecast revenue for a given product with the same degree of accuracy.\\nThe key difference among the three forecasts is the degree of aggregation.\\nThe GDP is an aggregation across many companies, and the earnings of a company are an aggregation across several product lines.\\nThe greater the aggregation, the more accurate is the forecast.\\nIn general, the farther up the supply chain a company is (or the farther it is from the consumer), the greater is the distortion of information it receives.\\nOne classic example of this is the bullwhip effect (see Chapter 10), in which order variation is amplified as orders move farther from the end customer.\\nAs a result, the farther up the supply chain an enterprise is, the larger is the forecast error.\\nCollaborative forecasting based on sales to the end customer helps upstream enterprises reduce forecast error.\\nIn the next section, we discuss the basic components of a forecast, explain the four classifications into which forecasting methods fall, and introduce the notion of forecast error.\\nYogi Berra, the former New York Yankees catcher who is famous for his malapropisms, once said, \"Predictions are usually difficult, especially about the future.\"\\nOne may be tempted to treat demand forecasting as magic or art and leave everything to chance.\\nWhat a firm knows about its customers\\' past behavior, however, sheds light on their future behavior.\\nDemand does not arise in a vacuum.\\nRather, customer demand is influenced by a variety of factors and can be predicted, at least with some probability, if a company can determine the relationship between these factors and future demand.\\nTo forecast demand, companies must first identify the factors that influence future demand and then ascertain the relationship between these factors and future demand.\\nCompanies must balance objective and subjective factors when forecasting demand.\\nAlthough we focus on quantitative forecasting methods in this chapter, companies must include human input when they make their final forecast.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan illustrates this point.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan provides its store managers with a state-of-the-art decision support system that makes a demand forecast and provides a recommended order.\\nThe store manager, however, is responsible for making the final decision and placing the order, because he or she may have access to information about market conditions that are not available in historical demand data.\\nThis knowledge of market conditions is likely to improve the forecast.\\nFor example, if the store manager knows that the weather is likely to be rainy and cold the next day, he or she can reduce the size of an ice cream order to be placed with an upstream supplier, even if demand was high during the previous few days when the weather was hot.\\nIn this instance, a change in market conditions (the weather) would not have been predicted using historical demand data.\\nA supply chain can experience substantial payoffs from improving its demand forecasting through qualitative human inputs.\\nA company must be knowledgeable about numerous factors that are related to the demand forecast, including the following: ?Past demand ?Lead time of product replenishment ?Planned advertising or marketing efforts ?Planned price discounts ?State of the economy ?Actions that competitors have taken A company must understand such factors before it can select an appropriate forecasting methodology.\\nFor example, historically a firm may have experienced low demand for chicken noodle soup in July and high demand in December and January.\\nIf the firm decides to discount the product in July, the situation is likely to change, with some of the future demand shifting to the month of July.\\nThe firm should make its forecast taking this factor into consideration.\\nForecasting methods are classified according to the following four types: 1.\\nQualitative: Qualitative forecasting methods are primarily subjective and rely on human judgment.\\nThey are most appropriate when little historical data are available or when experts have market intelligence that may affect the forecast.\\nSuch methods may also be necessary to forecast demand several years into the future in a new industry.\\nTime series: Time-series forecasting methods use historical demand to make a forecast.\\nThey are based on the assumption that past demand history is a good indicator of future demand.\\nThese methods are most appropriate when the basic demand pattern does not vary significantly from one year to the next.\\nThese are the simplest methods to implement and can serve as a good starting point for a demand forecast.\\nCausal: Causal forecasting methods assume that the demand forecast is highly correlated with certain factors in the environment (the state of the economy, interest rates, etc.).\\nCausal forecasting methods find this correlation between demand and environmental factors and use estimates of what environmental factors will be to forecast future demand.\\nproduct pricing is strongly correlated with demand.\\nCompanies can thus use causal methods to determine the impact of price promotions on demand.\\nSimulation: Simulation forecasting methods imitate the consumer choices that give rise to demand to arrive at a forecast.\\nUsing simulation, a firm can combine time-series and causal methods to answer such questions as: What will be the impact of a price promotion?\\nWhat will be the impact of a competitor opening a store nearby?\\nAirlines simulate customer buying behavior to forecast demand for higher fare seats when there are no seats available at the lower fares.\\nA company may find it difficult to decide which method is most appropriate for forecasting.\\nIn fact, several studies have indicated that using multiple forecasting methods to create a combined forecast is more effective than using any one method alone.\\nIn this chapter, we deal primarily with time-series methods, which are most appropriate when future demand is related to historical demand, growth patterns, and any seasonal patterns.\\nWith any forecasting method, there is always a random element that cannot be explained by historical demand patterns.\\nTherefore, any observed demand can be broken down into a systematic and a random component: Observed demand 1O2 = systematic component 1S2 + random component 1R2 The systematic component measures the expected value of demand and consists of what we will call level, the current deseasonalized demand; trend, the rate of growth or decline in demand for the next period; and seasonality, the predictable seasonal fluctuations in demand.\\nThe random component is that part of the forecast that deviates from the systematic part.\\nA company cannot (and should not) forecast the direction of the random component.\\nAll a company can predict is the random component\\'s size and variability, which provides a measure of forecast error.\\nThe objective of forecasting is to filter out the random component (noise) and estimate the systematic component.\\nThe forecast error measures the difference between the forecast and actual demand.\\nOn average, a good forecasting method has an error whose size is comparable to the random component of demand.\\nA manager should be skeptical of a forecasting method that claims to have no forecasting error on historical demand.\\nIn this case, the method has merged the historical random component with the systematic component.\\nAs a result, the forecasting method will likely perform poorly.\\nThe following five points are important for an organization to forecast effectively: 1.\\nUnderstand the objective of forecasting.\\nIntegrate demand planning and forecasting throughout the supply chain.\\nIdentify the major factors that influence the demand forecast.\\nForecast at the appropriate level of aggregation.\\nEstablish performance and error measures for the forecast.\\nUnderstand the Objective of Forecasting Every forecast supports decisions that are based on it, so an important first step is to identify these decisions clearly.\\nExamples of such decisions include how much of a particular product to make, how much to inventory, and how much to order.\\nAll parties affected by a supply chain decision should be aware of the link between the decision and the forecast.\\nFor example, Wal-Mart\\'s plans to discount detergent during the month of July must be shared with the manufacturer, the transporter, and others involved in filling demand, as they all must make decisions that are affected by the forecast of demand.\\nAll parties should come up with a common forecast for the promotion and a shared plan of action based on the forecast.\\nFailure to make these decisions jointly may result in either too much or too little product in various stages of the supply chain.\\nIntegrate Demand Planning and Forecasting Throughout the Supply Chain A company should link its forecast to all planning activities throughout the supply chain.\\nThese include capacity planning, production planning, promotion planning, and purchasing, among others.\\nIn one unfortunately common scenario, a retailer develops forecasts based on promotional activities, whereas a manufacturer, unaware of these promotions, develops a different forecast for its production planning based on historical orders.\\nThis leads to a mismatch between supply and demand, resulting in poor customer service.\\nTo accomplish integration, it is a good idea for a firm to have a cross-functional team, with members from each affected function responsible for forecasting demand--and an even better idea is to have members of different companies in the supply chain working together to create a forecast.\\nIdentify Major Factors That Influence the Demand Forecast Next, a firm must identify demand, supply, and product-related phenomena that influence the demand forecast.\\nOn the demand side, a company must ascertain whether demand is growing or declining or has a seasonal pattern.\\nThese estimates must be based on demand--not sales data.\\nFor example, a supermarket promoted a certain brand of cereal in July 2011.\\nAs a result, the demand for this cereal was high while the demand for other, comparable cereal brands was low in July.\\nThe supermarket should not use the sales data from 2011 to estimate that demand for this brand will be high in July 2012, because this will occur only if the same brand is promoted again in July 2012 and other brands respond as they did the previous year.\\nWhen making the demand forecast, the supermarket must understand what the demand would have been in the absence of promotion activity and how demand is affected by promotions and competitor actions.\\nA combination of these pieces of information will allow the supermarket to forecast demand for July 2012 given the promotion activity planned for that year.\\nOn the supply side, a company must consider the available supply sources to decide on the accuracy of the forecast desired.\\nIf alternate supply sources with short lead times are available, a highly accurate forecast may not be especially important.\\nHowever, if only a single supplier with a long lead time is available, an accurate forecast will have great value.\\nOn the product side, a firm must know the number of variants of a product being sold and whether these variants substitute for or complement one another.\\nIf demand for a product influences or is influenced by demand for another product, the two forecasts are best made jointly.\\nFor example, when a firm introduces an improved version of an existing product, it is likely that the demand for the existing product will decline because customers will buy the improved version.\\nAlthough the decline in demand for the original product is not indicated by historical data, the historical demand is still useful in that it allows the firm to estimate the combined total demand for the two versions.\\nClearly, demand for the two products should be forecast jointly.\\nForecast at the Appropriate Level of Aggregation Given that aggregate forecasts are more accurate than disaggregate forecasts, it is important to forecast at a level of aggregation that is appropriate given the supply chain decision that is driven by the forecast.\\nConsider a buyer at a retail chain who is forecasting in order to pick an order size for shirts.\\nOne approach is to ask each store manager the precise number of shirts needed and add up all the requests to get an order size with the supplier.\\nThe advantage of this approach is that it uses local market intelligence that each store manager has.\\nThe problem with this approach is that it makes store managers forecast well before demand arises at a time when their disaggregate forecasts are unlikely to be accurate.\\nA better approach may be to forecast demand at the aggregate level when ordering with the supplier and ask each store manager to forecast only when the shirts are to be allocated across the stores.\\nIn this case, the long lead time forecast (supplier order) is aggregate, thus lowering error.\\nThe disaggregate store-level forecast is made close to the sales season when local market intelligence is likely to be most effective.\\nEstablish Performance and Error Measures for the Forecast Companies should establish clear performance measures to evaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the forecast.\\nThese measures should be highly correlated with the objectives of the business decisions based on these forecasts.\\nConsider a mail-order company that uses a forecast to place orders with its suppliers up the supply chain.\\nSuppliers take two months to send in the orders.\\nThe mail-order company must ensure that the forecast is created at least two months before the start of the sales season because of the two-month lead time for replenishment.\\nAt the end of the sales season, the company must compare actual demand to forecasted demand to estimate the accuracy of the forecast.\\nThen plans for decreasing future forecast errors or responding to the observed forecast errors can be put into place.\\nIn the next section, we discuss techniques for static and adaptive time-series forecasting.\\nThe goal of any forecasting method is to predict the systematic component of demand and estimate the random component.\\nIn its most general form, the systematic component of demand data contains a level, a trend, and a seasonal factor.\\nThe equation for calculating the systematic component may take a variety of forms: ?Multiplicative: Systematic component = level * trend * seasonal factor ?Additive: Systematic component = level + trend + seasonal factor ?Mixed: Systematic component = (level + trend) * seasonal factor The specific form of the systematic component applicable to a given forecast depends on the nature of demand.\\nCompanies may develop both static and adaptive forecasting methods for each form.\\nWe now describe these static and adaptive forecasting methods.\\nStatic Methods A static method assumes that the estimates of level, trend, and seasonality within the systematic component do not vary as new demand is observed.\\nIn this case, we estimate each of these parameters based on historical data and then use the same values for all future forecasts.\\nIn this section, we discuss a static forecasting method for use when demand has a trend as well as a seasonal component.\\nWe assume that the systematic component of demand is mixed, that is,  Systematic component = (level + trend) * seasonal factor  A similar approach can be applied for other forms as well.\\nWe begin with a few basic definitions: L  estimate of level at t  0 (the deseasonalized demand estimate during Period t  0) T  estimate of trend (increase or decrease in demand per period) St  estimate of seasonal factor for Period t Dt  actual demand observed in Period t Ft  forecast of demand for Period t In a static forecasting method, the forecast in Period t for demand in Period t  l is a product of the level in Period t  l and the seasonal factor for Period t  l. The level in Period t  l is the sum of the level in Period 0 (L) and (t  l) times the trend T. The forecast in Period t for demand in Period t  l is thus given as  Ft+l = [L + (t + l)T]St+l  .\\nTable 7-1 Quarterly Demand for Tahoe Salt  Year  Quarter  Period, t  Demand, Dt  1 2 1 8,000  13  2 13,000  14  3 23,000  21  4 34,000  22  5 10,000  23  6 18,000  24  7 23,000  31  8 38,000  32  9 12,000  3 3 10 13,000  3 4 11 32,000  4 1 12 41,000  We now describe one method for estimating the three parameters L, T, and S. As an example, consider the demand for rock salt used primarily to melt snow.\\nThis salt is produced by a firm called Tahoe Salt, which sells its salt through a variety of independent retailers around the Lake Tahoe area of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\\nIn the past, Tahoe Salt has relied on estimates of demand from a sample of its retailers, but the company has noticed that these retailers always overestimate their purchases, leaving Tahoe (and even some retailers) stuck with excess inventory.\\nAfter meeting with its retailers, Tahoe has decided to produce a collaborative forecast.\\nTahoe Salt wants to work with the retailers to create a more accurate forecast based on the actual retail sales of their salt.\\nQuarterly retail demand data for the past three years are shown in Table 7-1 and charted in Figure 7-1.\\nIn Figure 7-1, observe that demand for salt is seasonal, increasing from the second quarter of a given year to the first quarter of the following year.\\nThe second quarter of each year has the lowest demand.\\nEach cycle lasts four quarters, and the demand pattern repeats every year.\\nThere is also a growth trend in the demand, with sales growing over the past three years.\\nThe company estimates that growth will continue in the coming year at historical rates.\\nWe now describe how each of the three parameters--level, trend, and seasonal factors--may be estimated.\\nThe following two steps are necessary to making this estimation: 1.\\nDeseasonalize demand and run linear regression to estimate level and trend.\\nEstimate seasonal factors.\\nDemand  50,000 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000 0 1, 2 1, 3 1, 4 2, 1 2, 2 2, 3 2, 4 3, 1 3, 2 3, 3 3, 4 4, 1 Period .\\nESTIMATING LEVEL AND TREND The objective of this step is to estimate the level at Period 0  and the trend.\\nWe start by deseasonalizing the demand data.\\nDeseasonalized demand represents  the demand that would have been observed in the absence of seasonal fluctuations.\\nThe  periodicity (p) is the number of periods after which the seasonal cycle repeats.\\nFor Tahoe Salt\\'s  demand, the pattern repeats every year.\\nGiven that we are measuring demand on a quarterly  basis, the periodicity for the demand in Table 7-1 is p  4.\\nTo ensure that each season is given equal weight when deseasonalizing demand, we take the  average of p consecutive periods of demand.\\nThe average of demand from Period l  1 to Period  l  p provides deseasonalized demand for Period l  (p  1)/2.\\nIf p is odd, this method provides  deseasonalized demand for an existing period.\\nIf p is even, this method provides deseasonalized  demand at a point between Period l  (p/2) and Period l  1  (p/2).\\nBy taking the average of  deaseasonalized demand provided by Periods l  1 to l  p and l  2 to l  p  1, we obtain the  deseasonalized demand demand, D-t, for Period  for Period l  1  (p/2).\\nThis t, is formulated as follows:  procedure  for  obtaining  the  deseasonalized  t - 1 + (p/2)  D-t  =  c Dt - (p/2) e  +  Dt+(p/2) + a 2Di d n (2p) for p even i = t + 1 - (p/2) t + [(p - 1)/2]  a Di /p for p odd i = t - [(p - 1)/2]  .\\nD-3 = c Dt - 1p>22 + Dt + 1p>22 +  t - 1 + 1p>22  4  a 2Di d n (2 p) = D1 + D5 + a 2Di n8  i = t + 1 - 1p>22  i=2  With this procedure, we can obtain deseasonalized demand between Periods 3 and 10 as shown in Figures 7-2 and 7-3.\\nThe following linear relationship exists between the deseasonalized demand, D-t, and time t, based on the change in demand over time.\\nCell Cell Formula C4 =(B2+B6+2*SUM(B3:B5))/8  .\\n50,000 40,000 30,000  Actual Demand  Deseasonalized Demand  Demand  20,000  10,000  01 2 3 4 5 6 7 Period .\\nInput Y Range: C4:C11 Input X Range: A4:A11  and click the OK button.\\nA new sheet containing the results of the regression opens up.\\nThis new sheet contains estimates for both the initial level L and the trend T. The initial level, L,  is obtained as the intercept coefficient, and the trend, T, is obtained as the X variable coefficient  (or the slope) from the sheet containing the regression results.\\nFor the Tahoe Salt example, we obtain L  18,439 and T  524.\\nFor this example, deseasonalized demand D-t for any Period t is thus given by  D-t = 18,439 + 524t  .\\nNote that it is not appropriate to run a linear regression between the original demand data and time to estimate level and trend because the original demand data are not linear and the resulting linear regression will not be accurate.\\nThe demand must be deseasonalized before we run the linear regression.\\nESTIMATING SEASONAL FACTORS We can now obtain deseasonalized demand for each  .\\nfactor as  St  for  Period  t  is  the  ratio  of  actual  demand  Dt  to  S-t =  Di D-t  .\\nGiven the periodicity, p, we obtain the seasonal factor for a given period by averaging seasonal factors that correspond to similar periods.\\nFor example, if we have a periodicity of p  4, Periods 1, 5, and 9 have similar seasonal factors.\\nThe seasonal factor for these periods is obtained  .\\nCell  Cell Formula  Equation  .\\nCopied to C3:C13 D3:D13  .\\nas the average of the three seasonal factors.\\nGiven r seasonal cycles in the data, for all periods of the form pt + i, 1 ... i ... p, we obtain the seasonal factor as  r-1  a Sjp + i  Si  =  j=0 r  .\\nS1 = 1S1 + S5 + S92/3 = 10.42 + 0.47 + 0.522/3 = 0.47 S2 = 1S2 + S6 + S102/3 = 10.67 + 0.83 + 0.552/3 = 0.68 S3 = 1S3 + S7 + S112/3 = 11.15 + 1.04 + 1.322/3 = 1.17 S4 = 1S4 + S8 + S122/3 = 11.66 + 1.68 + 1.662/3 = 1.67 .\\nF13 = 1L + 13T2S13 = 118,439 + 13 * 52420.47 = 11,868 F14 = 1L + 14T2S14 = 118,439 + 14 * 52420.68 = 17,527 F15 = 1L + 15T2S15 = 118,439 + 15 * 52421.17 = 30,770 F16 = 1L + 16T2S16 = 118,439 + 16 * 52421.67 = 44,794 Tahoe Salt and its retailers now have a more accurate forecast of demand.\\nWithout the sharing of sell-through information between the retailers and the manufacturer, this supply chain would have a less accurate forecast and a variety of production and inventory inefficiencies would result.\\nAdaptive Forecasting  In adaptive forecasting, the estimates of level, trend, and seasonality are updated after each demand observation.\\nThe main advantage of adaptive forecasting is that estimates incorporate all new data that are observed.\\nWe now discuss a basic framework and several methods that can be used for this type of forecast.\\nThe framework is provided in the most general setting, when the systematic component of demand data contains a level, a trend, and a seasonal factor.\\nThe framework we present is for the case in which the systematic component has the mixed form.\\nIt can, however, easily be modified for the other two cases.\\nThe framework can also be specialized for the case in which the systematic component contains no seasonality or trend.\\nWe assume that we have a set of historical data for n periods and that demand is seasonal with periodicity p. Given quarterly data, wherein the pattern repeats itself every year, we have a periodicity of p  4.\\nWe begin by defining a few terms:  Lt  estimate of level at the end of Period t Tt  estimate of trend at the end of Period t St  estimate of seasonal factor for Period t Ft  forecast of demand for Period t (made in Period t  1 or earlier) Dt actual demand observed in Period t Et  Ft ?Dt  forecast error in Period t  In adaptive methods, the forecast for Period t  l in Period t uses the estimate of level and trend in Period t (Lt and Tt respectively) and is given as  Ft + l = 1Lt + lTt2St + l  .\\nThe four steps in the adaptive forecasting framework are as follows:  1.\\nInitialize: Compute initial estimates of the level (L0), trend (T0), and seasonal factors (S1,..., Sp) from the given data.\\nThis is done exactly as in the static forecasting method discussed earlier in the chapter with L0  L and T0  T. 2.\\nForecast: Given the estimates in Period t, forecast demand for Period t  1 using .\\ntrend, and seasonal factor at Period 0.\\nEstimate error: Record the actual demand Dt+1 for Period t  1 and compute the error Et+1 in the forecast for Period t  1 as the difference between the forecast and the actual demand.\\nThe error for Period t  1 is stated as  Et + 1 = Ft + 1 - Dt + 1  .\\nModify estimates: Modify the estimates of level (Lt+1), trend (Tt+1), and seasonal factor (St+p+1), given the error Et1 in the forecast.\\nIt is desirable that the modification be such that if the demand is lower than forecast, the estimates are revised downward, whereas if the demand is higher than forecast, the estimates are revised upward.\\nThe revised estimates in Period t  1 are then used to make a forecast for Period t  2, and Steps 2, 3, and 4 are repeated until all historical data up to Period n have been covered.\\nThe estimates at Period n are then used to forecast future demand.\\nWe now discuss various adaptive forecasting methods.\\nThe method that is most appropriate depends on the characteristic of demand and the composition of the systematic component of demand.\\nIn each case, we assume the period under consideration to be t.  MOVING AVERAGE The moving average method is used when demand has no observable trend or seasonality.\\nIn this case, Systematic component of demand = level  .\\nIn this method, the level in Period t is estimated as the average demand over the most recent N periods.\\nThis represents an N-period moving average and is evaluated as follows:  Lt = 1Dt + Dt - 1 + ?+ Dt - N + 12/N  .\\nThe current forecast for all future periods is the same and is based on the current estimate of level.\\nThe forecast is stated as  Ft + 1 = Lt and Ft + n = Lt After observing the demand for Period t  1, we revise the estimates as follows: Lt + 1 = 1Dt + 1 + Dt + ?+ Dt - N + 22/N, Ft + 2 = Lt + 1  .\\nTo compute the new moving average, we simply add the latest observation and drop the oldest one.\\nThe revised moving average serves as the next forecast.\\nThe moving average corresponds to giving the last N periods of data equal weight when forecasting and ignoring all data older than this new moving average.\\nAs we increase N, the moving average becomes less responsive to the most recently observed demand.\\nWe illustrate the use of the moving average in Example 7-1.\\nEXAMPLE 7-1 Moving Average A supermarket has experienced weekly demand of milk of D1  120, D2 127, D3 114, and D4 122 gallons over the past four weeks.\\nForecast demand for Period 5 using a four-period moving average.\\nWhat is the forecast error if demand in Period 5 turns out to be 125 gallons?\\nF5 = L4 = 120.75 gallons As demand in Period 5, D5, is 125 gallons, we have a forecast error for Period 5 of E5 = F5 - D5 = 125 - 120.75 = 4.25 After observing demand in Period 5, the revised estimate of level for Period 5 is given by L5 = 1D5 + D4 + D3 + D22/4 = 1125 + 122 + 114 + 1272/4 = 122  SIMPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING The simple exponential smoothing method is appropriate when demand has no observable trend or seasonality.\\nIn this case, Systematic component of demand = level  The initial estimate of level, L0, is taken to be the average of all historical data because demand has been assumed to have no observable trend or seasonality.\\nGiven demand data for Periods 1 through n, we have the following:  1n  L0 =  n  a Di i=1  .\\nThe current forecast for all future periods is equal to the current estimate of level and is given as  Ft + 1 = Lt and Ft + n = Lt  .\\nAfter observing the demand, Dt1, for Period t  1, we revise the estimate of the level as follows:  Lt+1 = aDt+1 + 11 - a2Lt  .\\nt-1 Lt+1 = a a11 - a2nDt+1-n + 11 - a2tD1 n=0 The current estimate of the level is a weighted average of all of the past observations of demand, with recent observations weighted higher than older observations.\\nA higher value of a corresponds to a forecast that is more responsive to recent observations, whereas a lower value of a represents a more stable forecast that is less responsive to recent observations.\\nWe illustrate the use of exponential smoothing in Example 7-2.\\nEXAMPLE 7-2 Simple Exponential Smoothing Consider the supermarket in Example 7-1, in which weekly demand for milk has been D1  120, D2 127, D3 114, and D4 122 gallons over the past four weeks.\\nForecast demand for Period 5 using simple exponential smoothing with a = 0.1. .\\n4 L0 = a Di/4 = 120.75 i=1 .\\nF1 = L0 = 120.75 The observed demand for Period 1 is D1  120.\\nThe forecast error for Period 1 is given by E1 = F1 - D1 = 120.75 - 120 = 0.75 .\\nL1 = aD1 + 11 - a2L0 = 0.1 * 120 + 0.9 * 120.75 = 120.68 Observe that the estimate of level for Period 1 is lower than for Period 0 because the demand in Period 1 is lower than the forecast for Period 1.\\nWe thus obtain F2  L1  120.68.\\nGiven that D2  127, we obtain L2  0.1  127  0.9  120.68  121.31.\\nThis gives F3  L2  121.31.\\nGiven that D3  114, we obtain L3  0.1  114  0.9  121.31  120.58.\\nThis gives F4  L3  120.58.\\nGiven that D4  122, we obtain L4  0.1  122  0.9  120.58  120.72.\\nThis gives F5  L4  120.72.\\nTREND-CORRECTED EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (HOLT\\'S MODEL) The trend-corrected exponential smoothing (Holt\\'s model) method is appropriate when demand is assumed to have a level and a trend in the systematic component but no seasonality.\\nIn this case, we have Systematic component of demand = level + trend  .\\nWe obtain an initial estimate of level and trend by running a linear regression between demand Dt and time Period t of the form Dt = at + b  In this case, running a linear regression between demand and time periods is appropriate because we have assumed that demand has a trend but no seasonality.\\nThe underlying relation- ship between demand and time is thus linear.\\nThe constant b measures the estimate of demand at Period t  0 and is our estimate of the initial level L0.\\nThe slope a measures the rate of change in demand per period and is our initial estimate of the trend T0.\\nIn Period t, given estimates of level Lt and trend Tt, the forecast for future periods is expressed as  Ft + 1 = Lt + Tt and Ft + n = Lt + nTt  .\\nAfter observing demand for Period t, we revise the estimates for level and trend as follows:  Lt+1 = aDt+1 + 11 - a21Lt + Tt2 Tt+1 = b1Lt+1 - Lt2 + 11 - b2Tt  .\\nwhere a is a smoothing constant for the level, 0 6 a 6 1, and b is a smoothing constant for the trend, 0 6 b 6 1.\\nObserve that in each of the two updates, the revised estimate (of level or trend) is a weighted average of the observed value and the old estimate.\\nWe illustrate the use of Holt\\'s model in Example 7-3.\\nEXAMPLE 7-3 Holt\\'s Model An electronics manufacturer has seen demand for its latest MP3 player increase over the past six months.\\nObserved demand (in thousands) has been D1  8,415, D2  8,732, D3  9,014, D4  9,808, D5  10,413, and D6  11,961.\\nForecast demand for Period 7 using trend-corrected exponential smoothing with a = 0.1, b = 0.2.\\nAnalysis: The first step is to obtain initial estimates of level and trend using linear regression.\\nWe first run a linear regression (using the Excel tool Data | Data Analysis | Regression) between demand and time periods.\\nThe estimate of initial level L0 is obtained as the intercept coefficient, and the trend T0 is obtained as the X variable coefficient (or the slope).\\nFor the MP3 player data, we obtain L0 = 7,367 and T0 = 673 .\\nF1 = L0 + T0 = 7,367 + 673 = 8,040 The observed demand for Period 1 is D1 = 8,415.\\nThe error for Period 1 is thus given by E1 = F1 - D1 = 8,040 - 8,415 = - 375 .\\nL1 = aD1 + 11 - a21L0 + T02 = 0.1 * 8,415 + 0.9 * 8,040 = 8,078 T1 = b1L1 - L02 + 11 - b2T0 = 0.2 * 18,078 - 7,3672 + 0.8 * 673 = 681 Observe that the initial estimate for demand in Period 1 is too low.\\nAs a result, our updates have increased the estimate of level L1 for Period 1 from 8,040 to 8,078 and the  .\\nF2 = L1 + T1 = 8,078 + 681 = 8,759 Continuing in this manner, we obtain L2 = 8,755, T2 = 680, L3 = 9,393, T3 = 672, L4 = 10,039, T4 = 666, L5 = 10,676, T5 = 661, L6 = 11,399, T6 = 673.\\nThis gives us a forecast for Period 7 of F7 = L6 + T6 = 11,399 + 673 = 12,072  TREND- AND SEASONALITY-CORRECTED EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (WINTER\\'S MODEL) This method is appropriate when the systematic component of demand has a level, a trend, and a seasonal factor.\\nIn this case we have  Systematic component of demand = 1level + trend2 * seasonal factor  Assume periodicity of demand to be p. To begin, we need initial estimates of level (L0), trend (T0), and seasonal factors (S1, .\\nWe obtain these estimates using the procedure for static forecasting described earlier in the chapter.\\nIn Period t, given estimates of level, Lt, trend, Tt, and seasonal factors, St, .\\n., St+p-1, the forecast for future periods is given by  Ft + 1 = 1Lt + Tt2St + 1 and Ft + l = 1Lt + lTt2St + l  .\\nOn observing demand for Period t + 1, we revise the estimates for level, trend, and seasonal factors as follows:  Lt+1 = a1Dt+1/St+12 + 11 - a21Lt + Tt2  .\\nTt+1 = b1Lt+1 - Lt2 + 11 - b2Tt  .\\nSt + p + 1 = g1Dt + 1/Lt + 12 + 11 - g2St + 1  .\\nwhere a is a smoothing constant for the level, 0 6 a 6 1; b is a smoothing constant for the trend, 0 6 b 6 1; and g is a smoothing constant for the seasonal factor, 0 6 g 6 1.\\nObserve that in each of the updates (level, trend, or seasonal factor), the revised estimate is a weighted average of the observed value and the old estimate.\\nWe illustrate the use of Winter\\'s model in Example 7-4.\\nEXAMPLE 7-4 Winter\\'s Model Consider the Tahoe Salt demand data in Table 7-1.\\nForecast demand for Period 1 using trend-and seasonality-corrected exponential smoothing with a = 0.1, b = 0.2, g = 0.1.\\nAnalysis: We obtain the initial estimates of level, trend, and seasonal factors exactly as in the static case.\\nThey are expressed as follows: .\\nF1 = 1L0 + T02S1 = 118,439 + 52420.47 = 8,913 The observed demand for Period 1 is D1  8,000.\\nThe forecast error for Period 1 is thus given by E1 = F1 - D1 = 8,913 - 8,000 = 913  .\\nL1 = a1D1/S12 + 11 - a21L0 + T02 = 0.1 * 18,000/0.472 + 0.9 * 118,439 + 5242 = 18,769 .\\nF2 = 1L1 + T12S2 = 118,769 + 48520.68 = 13,093  The forecasting methods we have discussed and the situations in which they are generally applicable are as follows:  Forecasting Method Moving average Simple exponential smoothing Holt\\'s model Winter\\'s model  Applicability No trend or seasonality No trend or seasonality Trend but no seasonality Trend and seasonality  If Tahoe Salt uses an adaptive forecasting method for the sell-through data obtained from its retailers, Winter\\'s model is the best choice, because its demand experiences both a trend and seasonality.\\nIf we do not know that Tahoe Salt experiences both trend and seasonality, how can we find out?\\nForecast error helps identify instances in which the forecasting method being used is inappropriate.\\nIn the next section, we describe how a manager can estimate and use forecast error.\\nAs mentioned earlier, every instance of demand has a random component.\\nA good forecasting method should capture the systematic component of demand but not the random component.\\nThe random component manifests itself in the form of a forecast error.\\nForecast errors contain valuable information and must be analyzed carefully for two reasons: 1.\\nManagers use error analysis to determine whether the current forecasting method is predicting the systematic component of demand accurately.\\nFor example, if a forecasting method consistently produces a positive error, the forecasting method is overestimating the systematic component and should be corrected.\\nAll contingency plans must account for forecast error.\\nConsider a mail-order company with two suppliers.\\nThe first is in the Far East and has a lead time of two months.\\nThe second is local and can fill orders with one week\\'s notice.\\nThe local supplier is more expensive than the Far East supplier.\\nThe mail-order company wants to contract a certain amount of contingency capacity with the local supplier to be used if the demand exceeds the quantity the Far East supplier provides.\\nThe decision regarding the quantity of local capacity to contract is closely linked to the size of the forecast error.\\nAs long as observed errors are within historical error estimates, firms can continue to use their current forecasting method.\\nFinding an error that is well beyond historical estimates may indicate that the forecasting method in use is no longer appropriate or demand has fundamentally changed.\\nIf all of a firm\\'s forecasts tend to consistently over- or underestimate demand, this may be another signal that the firm should change its forecasting method.\\nAs defined earlier, forecast error for Period t is given by Et, where the following holds: Et = Ft - Dt  That is, the error in Period t is the difference between the forecast for Period t and the actual demand in Period t. It is important that a manager estimate the error of a forecast made at least as far in advance as the lead time required for the manager to take whatever action the forecast is to be used for.\\nFor example, if a forecast will be used to determine an order size and the supplier\\'s lead time is six months, a manager should estimate the error for a forecast made six months before demand arises.\\nIn a situation with a six-month lead time, there is no point in estimating errors for a forecast made one month in advance.\\nMSEn =  1 n  n a Et2 t=1  .\\nThe MSE can be related to the variance of the forecast error.\\nIn effect, we estimate that the random component of demand has a mean of 0 and a variance of MSE.\\nThe MSE penalizes large errors much more significantly than small errors because all errors are squared.\\nThus, if we select forecast methods by minimizing MSE, a method with a forecast error sequence of 10, 12, 9, and 9 will be preferred to a method with an error sequence of 1, 3, 2, and 20.\\nThus, it is a good idea to use the MSE to compare forecasting methods if the cost of a large error is much larger than the gains from very accurate forecasts.\\nUsing the MSE as a measure of error is appropriate when forecast error has a distribution that is symmetric about zero.\\nDefine the absolute deviation in Period t, At, to be the absolute value of the error in Period t; that is,  At =  Et  Define the mean absolute deviation (MAD) to be the average of the absolute deviation over all periods, as expressed by  MADn =  1n  n  a At t=1  .\\nThe MAD can be used to estimate the standard deviation of the random component assuming that the random component is normally distributed.\\nIn this case the standard deviation of the random component is  s = 1.25 MAD  .\\nWe then estimate that the mean of the random component is 0, and the standard deviation of the random component of demand is s. MAD is a better measure of error than MSE if the  forecast error does not have a symmetric distribution.\\nEven when the error distribution is  symmetric, MAD is an appropriate choice when selecting forecasting methods if the cost of a  forecast error is proportional to the size of the error.\\nThe mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is the average absolute error as a percentage  of demand and is given by  MAPEn =  n a t=1    Et Dt    100  n  .\\nThe MAPE is a good measure of forecast error when the underlying forecast has significant seasonality and demand varies considerably from one period to the next.\\nConsider a scenario where two methods are used to make quarterly forecasts for a product with seasonal demand that peaks in the third quarter.\\nMethod 1 returns forecast errors of 190, 200, 245, and 180;  .\\nMethod 2 returns forecast errors of 100, 120, 500, and 100 over four quarters.\\nMethod 1 has a lower MSE and MAD relative to Method 2 and would be preferred if either criterion was used.\\nIf demand is highly seasonal, however, and averages 1,000, 1,200, 4,800, and 1,100 in the four periods, Method 2 results in MAPE  9.9%, while Method 1 results in a much higher MAPE  14.3%.\\nIn this instance, it can be argued that Method 2 should be preferred to Method 1.\\nWhen a forecast method stops reflecting the underlying demand pattern (e.g., if demand drops considerably as it did for the automotive industry in 2008/2009), the forecast errors are unlikely to be randomly distributed around 0.\\nIn general, one needs a method to track and control the forecasting method.\\nOne approach is to use the sum of forecast errors to evaluate the bias, where the following holds:  n biasn = a Et t=1  .\\nThe bias will fluctuate around 0 if the error is truly random and not biased one way or the other.\\nIdeally, if we plot all the errors, the slope of the best straight line passing through should be 0.\\nThe tracking signal (TS) is the ratio of the bias and the MAD and is given as  TSt  =  biast MADt  .\\nIf the TS at any period is outside the range ; 6, this is a signal that the forecast is biased and is either underforecasting (TS 6 - 6) or overforecasting (TS 7 + 6).\\nThis may happen because the forecasting method is flawed or the underlying demand pattern has shifted.\\nOne instance in which a large negative TS will result occurs when demand has a growth trend and the manager is using a forecasting method such as moving average.\\nBecause trend is not included, the average of historical demand is always lower than future demand.\\nThe negative TS detects that the forecasting method consistently underestimates demand and alerts the manager.\\nThe tracking signal may also get large when demand has suddenly dropped (as it did for many industries in 2009) or increased by a significant amount making historical data less relevant.\\nIf demand has suddenly dropped, it makes sense to increase the weight on current data relative to older data when making forecasts.\\nMcClain (1981) recommends the \"declining alpha\" method when using exponential smoothing where the smoothing constant starts large (to give greater weight to recent data) but then decreases over time.\\nIf we are aiming for a long-term smoothing constant of   1?, a declining alpha approach would be to start with 0  1 and reset the smoothing constant as follows:  at  =  r  at - 1 + at - 1  =  1 1  -  r rt  In the long term, the smoothing constant will converge to   1  with the forecasts becoming more stable over time.\\nWhen using exponential smoothing, the value of the smoothing constant chosen has a direct impact on the sensitivity of the forecast to recent data.\\nIf a manager has a good sense of the underlying demand pattern, it is best to use a smoothing constant that is no larger than 0.2.\\nIn general, it is best to pick smoothing constants that minimize the error term that a manager is most comfortable with from among MSE, MAD, and MAPE.\\nIn the absence of a preference among error terms, it is best to pick smoothing constants that minimize the MSE.\\nas shown in Figure 7-5.\\nThe forecast shown in Figure 7-5 uses the resulting   0.54 and gives MSE  2,460, MAD  42.5, and MAPE  2.1 percent.\\nThe smoothing constant can also be selected using Solver by minimizing the MAD or the MAPE at the end of 10 periods.\\nIn Figure 7-6, we show the results from minimizing MAD (cell G13).\\nThe forecasts and errors with the resulting   0.32 are shown in Figure 7-6.\\nIn this case, the MSE increases to 2,570 (compared to 2,460 in Figure 7-5) while the MAD decreases to 39.2 (compared to 42.5 in Figure 7-5) and the MAPE decreases to 2.0 percent (compared to 2.1 percent in Figure 7-5).\\nThe major difference between the two forecasts is in Period 9 (the period with the largest error shown in cell D11), where minimizing MSE picks a smoothing constant that reduces large errors, while minimizing MAD picks a smoothing constant that gives equal weight to reducing all errors even if large errors get somewhat larger.\\nCell  Cell Formula  Equation  Copied to  .\\nF6 =Abs(E6)  F7:F13  .\\nG7:G13 H7:H13 I7:I13  .\\nJ7:J13 K7:K13  operations for Tahoe Salt to come up with this forecast.\\nThe forecasting team decides to apply each of the adaptive forecasting methods discussed in this chapter to the historical data.\\nThe goal is to select the most appropriate forecasting method and then use it to forecast demand for the next four quarters.\\nThe team decides to select the forecasting method based on the errors that result when each method is used on the 12 quarters of historical demand data.\\nDemand in this case clearly has both a trend and seasonality in the systematic component.\\nThus, the team initially expects Winter\\'s model to produce the best forecast.\\nAs indicated by column K in Figure 7-7, the TS is well within the ; 6 range, which indicates that the forecast using the four-period moving average does not contain any significant bias.\\nIt does, however, have a fairly large MAD12 of 9,719, with a MAPE12 of 49 percent.\\nFrom Figure 7-7, observe that L12 = 24,500  .\\nF13 = F14 = F15 = F16 = L12 = 24,500 Given that MAD12 is 9,719, the estimate of standard deviation of forecast error, using a four-period moving average, is 1.25 * 9,719 = 12,148.\\nIn this case, the standard deviation of forecast error is fairly large relative to the size of the forecast.\\nSimple Exponential Smoothing .\\nL0 = 22,083  Cell  Cell Formula  Equation  C3  =0.1*B3+(1-  .\\nH3  =Sum($G$3:G3)/A3  .\\nI3 =100*(F3/B3)  J3  =Average($I$3:I3)  .\\nK3  =Sum($F$3:F3)/H3  .\\nCopied to C4:C14 D4:D14 E4:E14 F4:F14 G4:G14 H4:H14 I4:I14 J4:J14 K4:K14  .\\nAs indicated by the TS, which ranges from 1.38 to 2.15, the forecast using simple exponential smoothing with a = 0.1 does not indicate any significant bias.\\nHowever, it has a fairly large MAD12 of 10,208, with a MAPE12 of 59 percent.\\nFrom Figure 7-8, observe that L12 = 23,490 .\\nF13 = F14 = F15 = F16 = L12 = 23,490 In this case, MAD12 is 10,208 and MAPE12 is 59 percent.\\nThus, the estimate of standard deviation of forecast error using simple exponential smoothing is 1.25 * 10,208 = 12,761.\\nIn this case, the standard deviation of forecast error is fairly large relative to the size of the forecast.\\nTrend-Corrected Exponential Smoothing (Holt\\'s Model) The team next investigates the use of Holt\\'s model.\\nIn this case, the systematic component of demand is given by Systematic component of demand = level + trend The team applies the methodology discussed earlier.\\nAs a first step, it estimates the level at Period 0 and the initial trend.\\nAs described in Example 7-3, this estimate is obtained by running a linear regression between demand, Dt, and time, Period t. From the regression of the available data, the team obtains the following: L0 = 12,015 and T0 = 1,549 .\\nAs indicated by a TS that ranges from 2.15 to 2.00, trend-corrected exponential smoothing with a = 0.1 and b = 0.2 does not seem to significantly over- or underforecast.\\nHowever, the forecast has a fairly large MAD12 of 8,836, with a MAPE12 of 52 percent.\\nFrom Figure 7-9, observe that L12 = 30,443 and T12 = 1,541 .\\nF13 = L12 + T12 = 30,443 + 1,541 = 31,984 F14 = L12 + 2T12 = 30,443 + 2 * 1,541 = 33,525 F15 = L12 + 3T12 = 30,443 + 3 * 1,541 = 35,066 F16 = L12 + 4T12 = 30,443 + 4 * 1,541 = 36,607 In this case, MAD12  8,836.\\nThus, the estimate of standard deviation of forecast error using Holt\\'s model with a = 0.1 and b = 0.2 is 1.25 * 8,836 = 11,045.\\nIn this case, the standard deviation of forecast error relative to the size of the forecast is somewhat smaller than it was with the previous two methods.\\nHowever, it is still fairly large.\\n1 As a result of rounding, calculations done with only significant digits shown in the text may yield a different result.\\nThis is the case throughout the book.\\nCell Cell Formula C3 =0.1*B3+(1-0.1)*(C2+D2) D3

Period 0, and seasonal factors for Periods 1 through p  4.\\nTo start, the demand is deseasonalized.\\nThen, the team estimates initial level and trend by running a regression between deseasonalized demand and time.\\nThis information is used to estimate the seasonal factors.\\nFor the demand data in Figure 7-2, as discussed in Example 7-4, the team obtains the following: L0 = 18,439 T0 = 524 S1 = 0.47 S2 = 0.68 S3 = 1.17 S4 = 1.67 .\\nIn this case, the MAD of 1,469 and MAPE of 8 percent are significantly lower than with any of the other methods.\\nFrom Figure 7-10, observe that L12 = 24,791

is 1.25 * 1,469 = 1,836.\\nIn this case, the standard deviation of forecast error relative to the demand forecast is much smaller than with the other methods.\\nThe team compiles the error estimates for the four forecasting methods as shown in Table 7-2.\\nBased on the error information in Table 7-2, the forecasting team decides to use Winter\\'s model.\\nIt is not surprising that Winter\\'s model results in the most accurate forecast, because the  .\\nTable 7-2 Error Estimates for Tahoe Salt Forecasting  Forecasting Method  MAD  MAPE (%)  Four-period moving average Simple exponential

forecasting is performed, and the importance of getting the highest quality results possible.\\nThe forecasting module within a supply chain IT system, often called the demand planning module, is a core supply chain software product.\\nUtilizing the capabilities of IT in forecasting has several important advantages.\\nCommercial demand planning modules come with a variety of forecasting algorithms, which can be quite advanced and are sometimes proprietary.\\nThese methodologies often give a more accurate forecast than those produced through the use of a general package such as Excel.\\nMost demand planning applications make it fairly easy to test the various forecasting algorithms against historical data to determine the one that provides the best fit to the observed demand patterns.\\nThe availability of a variety of forecasting options is important because different forecasting algorithms provide different levels of quality depending on the actual demand patterns.\\nThe IT system can thus be used to best determine forecasting methods not just for the firm overall, but also by product categories and markets.\\nA good forecasting package provides forecasts across a wide range of products that are updated in real time by incorporating any new demand information.\\nThis helps firms respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and avoid the costs of a delayed reaction.\\nGood demand planning modules link not only to customer orders but often directly to customer sales information as well, thus incorporating the most current data into the demand forecast.\\nMuch of the progress in areas such as collaborative planning is due to IT innovations that allow the exchange and incorporation of forecasts between enterprises.\\nFinally, as the name demand planning suggests, these modules facilitate the shaping of demand.\\nGood demand planning modules contain tools to perform what-if analysis regarding the impact of potential changes in prices on demand.\\nThese tools help analyze the impact of promotions on demand and can be used to determine the extent and timing of promotions.\\nThis link is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9 under sales and operations planning.\\nKeep in mind that none of these tools is foolproof.\\nForecasts are virtually always inaccurate.\\nA good IT system should help track historical forecast errors so they can be incorporated into future decisions.\\nA well-structured forecast, along with a measure of error, can significantly improve decision making.\\nEven with all these sophisticated tools, sometimes it is  .\\nbetter to rely on human intuition in forecasting.\\nOne of the pitfalls of these IT tools is relying on them too much, which eliminates the human element in forecasting.\\nUse the forecasts and the value they deliver, but remember that they cannot assess some of the more qualitative aspects about future demand that you may be able to do on your own.\\nForecasting modules are available from all the major supply chain software companies, including the ERP firms such as SAP and Oracle.\\nA number of statistical analysis software firms, such as SAS and SPSS, have programs that can be used for forecasting.\\nA detailed list of forecasting software vendors is reported in the OR/MS Today forecasting software survey, and a discussion of each vendor is available at http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/surveys/FSS/ fss-fr.html.\\nThe risks associated with forecast error must be considered when planning for the future.\\nErrors in forecasting can cause significant misallocation of resources in inventory, facilities, transportation, sourcing, pricing, and even in information management.\\nForecast errors during network design may cause too many, too few, or the wrong type of facilities to be built.\\nPlans are determined from forecasts so the actual inventory, production, transportation, sourcing, and pricing plans that a company produces and follows depend on accurate forecasting.\\nEven on an operational level, forecasting plays a role in the actual day-to-day activities that are executed within a company.\\nAs one of the initial processes in each of these phases that affects many other processes, forecasting contains a significant amount of inherent risk.\\nA wide range of factors can cause a forecast to be inaccurate, but a few occur so often that they deserve specific mention.\\nLong lead times require forecasts to be made further in advance, thus decreasing the reliability of the forecast.\\nSeasonality also tends to increase forecast error.\\nForecast errors increase when product life cycles are short, because there are few historical data to build on when producing a forecast.\\nFirms with a few customers often experience lumpy demand that is harder to forecast than demand from many small customers, which tends to be smoother.\\nForecast quality suffers when it is based on orders placed by intermediaries in a supply chain rather than on end customer demand.\\nThis was particularly evident in the telecommunications sector in 2001, when manufacturer forecasts exceeded customer demand by a large amount.\\nWithout a view of end customer demand, a firm always has difficulty producing reliable forecasts.\\nTwo strategies used to mitigate forecast risk are increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain and utilizing opportunities for pooling of demand.\\nIncreased responsiveness allows the firm to reduce forecasting errors and thus decrease the associated risk.\\nZara and Seven-Eleven Japan have been successful by designing and operating responsive supply chains.\\nZara replenishes its stores several times a week while Seven-Eleven replenishes its stores several times a day.\\nAs a result, store managers in each case have to make short-term forecasts that are fairly accurate.\\nPooling, which we discuss in Chapter 12, attempts to smooth out lumpy demand by bringing together multiple sources of demand.\\nThus, Amazon has a lower forecast error than Barnes & Noble because it pools geographic demand into its warehouses.\\nImproved responsiveness and pooling often come at a cost.\\nIncreased speed may require capacity investment, whereas pooling tends to increase transportation cost.\\nTo achieve the right balance between risk mitigation and cost, it is important to tailor the mitigation strategies.\\nFor instance, when dealing with a commodity for which shortfalls can easily be made up for by spot market purchases, spending large amounts to increase the responsiveness of the supply chain is not warranted.\\nIn contrast, for a product with a short life cycle (e.g., trendy clothes as is the case with Zara), investing in responsiveness may be worth the cost.\\nSimilarly, the benefit from pooling is likely to be large only when the underlying forecast error is high and the product value is high relative to transportation cost.\\nAn investment in pooling efforts may not be justified for  .\\nproducts with small forecast errors.\\nBlue Nile has been successful pooling high-value diamonds whose demand is difficult to forecast.\\nIn contrast, detergent, which is easy to forecast and has high transport costs relative to its value, is typically sold through decentralized retail stores.\\nThese ideas are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 4, 12, and 13. .\\nCollaborate in building forecasts.\\nCollaboration with your supply chain partners can often create a much more accurate forecast.\\nIt takes an investment of time and effort to build the relationships with your partners to begin sharing information and creating collaborative forecasts.\\nHowever, the supply chain benefits of collaboration are often an order of magnitude greater than the cost (collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10).\\nThe reality today, however, is that most forecasts do not even account for all the information available across the different functions of a firm.\\nAs a result, firms should aim to put a sales and operations planning process in place (discussed in Chapter 9) that brings together the sales and operations functions when planning.\\nShare only the data that truly provide value.\\nThe value of data depends on where one sits in the supply chain.\\nA retailer finds point-of-sale data to be quite valuable in measuring the performance of its stores.\\nHowever, a manufacturer selling to a distributor who in turn sells to retailers does not need all the point-of-sale detail.\\nThe manufacturer finds aggregate demand data to be quite valuable, with marginally more value coming from detailed point-of-sale data.\\nKeeping the data shared to what is truly required decreases investment in IT and improves the chances of successful collaboration.\\nBe sure to distinguish between demand and sales.\\nOften, companies make the mistake of looking at historical sales and assuming that this is what the historical demand was.\\nTo get true demand, adjustments need to be made for unmet demand due to stockouts, competitor actions, pricing, and promotions.\\nFailure to do so results in forecasts that do not represent the current reality.\\nUnderstand the role of forecasting for both an enterprise and a supply chain.\\nForecasting is a key driver of virtually every design and planning decision made in both an enterprise and a supply chain.\\nEnterprises have always forecasted demand and used it to make decisions.\\nA relatively recent phenomenon, however, is to create collaborative forecasts for an entire supply chain and use these as the basis for decisions.\\nCollaborative forecasting greatly increases the accuracy of forecasts and allows the supply chain to maximize its performance.\\nWithout collaboration, supply chain stages farther from demand will likely have poor forecasts that will lead to supply chain inefficiencies and a lack of responsiveness.\\nIdentify the components of a demand forecast.\\nDemand consists of a systematic and a random component.\\nThe systematic component measures the expected value of demand.\\nThe random component measures fluctuations in demand from the expected value.\\nThe systematic component consists of level, trend, and seasonality.\\nLevel measures the current deseasonalized demand.\\nTrend measures the current rate of growth or decline in demand.\\nSeasonality indicates predictable seasonal fluctuations in demand.\\nForecast demand in a supply chain given historical demand data using time-series methodologies.\\nTime-series methods for forecasting are categorized as static or adaptive.\\nIn static methods, the estimates of parameters and demand patterns are not updated as new demand is observed.\\nStatic methods include regression.\\nIn adaptive methods, the estimates are  .\\nupdated each time a new demand is observed.\\nAdaptive methods include moving averages, simple exponential smoothing, Holt\\'s model, and Winter\\'s model.\\nMoving averages and simple exponential smoothing are best used when demand displays no trend or seasonality.\\nHolt\\'s model is best when demand displays a trend but no seasonality.\\nWinter\\'s model is appropriate when demand displays both trend and seasonality.\\nAnalyze demand forecasts to estimate forecast error.\\nForecast error measures the random component of demand.\\nThis measure is important because it reveals how inaccurate a forecast is likely to be and what contingencies a firm may have to plan for.\\nThe MSE, MAD, and MAPE are used to estimate the size of the forecast error.\\nThe bias and TS are used to estimate if the forecast consistently over- or underforecasts or if demand has deviated significantly from historical norms.\\n Identify the decisions that are best solved by aggregate planning.\\nUnderstand the importance of aggregate planning as a supply chain activity.\\nDescribe the information needed to produce an aggregate plan.\\nExplain the basic trade-offs to consider when creating an aggregate plan.\\nFormulate and solve basic aggregate planning problems using Microsoft Excel.\\nIn this chapter, we discuss how the aggregate planning methodology is used to make decisions about production, outsourcing, inventory, and backlogs in a supply chain.\\nWe identify the information required to produce an aggregate plan and outline the basic trade-offs that must be made to create an optimal aggregate plan.\\nWe also describe how to formulate and solve an aggregate planning problem using Microsoft Excel.\\nImagine a world in which manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and even information capacity are all limitless and free.\\nImagine lead times of zero, allowing goods to be produced and delivered instantaneously.\\nIn this world, there would be no need to plan in anticipation of demand, because whenever a customer demands a product, the demand would be instantly satisfied.\\nIn this world, aggregate planning plays no role.\\nIn the real world, however, capacity has a cost, and lead times are often long.\\nTherefore, companies must make decisions regarding capacity levels, production levels, outsourcing, and promotions well before demand is known.\\nA company must anticipate demand and determine, in advance of that demand, how to meet it.\\nShould a company invest in a plant with large capacity that is able to produce enough to satisfy demand even in the busiest months?\\nOr should a company build a smaller plant but incur the costs of holding inventory built during slow periods in anticipation of demand in later months?\\nThese are the types of questions that aggregate planning helps companies answer.\\nAggregate planning is a process by which a company determines planned levels of capacity, production, subcontracting, inventory, stockouts, and even pricing over a specified time horizon.\\nThe goal of aggregate planning is to build a plan that satisfies demand while maximizing profit.\\nAggregate planning, as the name suggests, solves problems involving aggregate decisions rather than stock-keeping unit (SKU)衍evel decisions.\\nFor example, aggregate planning determines the total production level in a plant for a given month, but it does so without determining the quantity of each individual SKU that will be produced.\\nThis level of detail makes aggregate planning a useful tool for thinking about decisions with an intermediate time frame of between roughly 3 and 18 months.\\nIn this time frame, it is too early to determine production levels by SKU, but it is also generally too late to arrange for additional capacity.\\nTherefore, aggregate planning answers the question: How should a firm best utilize the facilities that it currently has?\\nTo be effective, aggregate planning requires inputs from all stages of the supply chain, and its results have a tremendous impact on supply chain performance.\\nAs we saw in the previous chapter on forecasting, collaborative forecasts are created by multiple supply chain enterprises and are an important input for aggregate planning.\\nIn addition, many constraints that are key inputs to aggregate planning come from supply chain partners outside the enterprise.\\nWithout these inputs from both up and down the supply chain, aggregate planning cannot realize its full potential to create value.\\nThe output from aggregate planning is also of value to both upstream and downstream partners.\\nProduction plans for a firm define demand for suppliers and establish supply constraints for customers.\\nThis chapter is meant to create a foundation for using aggregate planning both solely within an enterprise as well as across the entire supply chain.\\nThe supply chain implications of aggregate planning will become even clearer in Chapter 9 in which we discuss sales and operations planning.\\nAs an example, consider how a premium paper supply chain uses aggregate planning to maximize profit.\\nMany types of paper mills face seasonal demand that ripples up from customers to printers to distributors and finally to the manufacturers.\\nMany types of premium paper have demand peaks in the spring, when annual reports are printed, and in the fall, when new-car brochures are released.\\nBuilding a mill with capacity to meet demand in the spring and fall on an as-needed basis is too costly, because of the high cost of mill capacity.\\nOn the other side of the supply chain, premium papers often require special additives and coatings that may be in short supply.\\nThe paper manufacturer must deal with these constraints and maximize profit around them.\\nTo deal with these potential problems, mills use aggregate planning to determine production levels and inventory levels that they should build up in the slower months for sale in the spring and fall when demand is greater than the mill\\'s capacity.\\nBy taking into account the inputs from throughout the supply chain, aggregate planning allows the mill and the supply chain to maximize profit.\\nThe aggregate planner\\'s main objective is to identify the following operational parameters over the specified time horizon: Production Rate: the number of units to be completed per unit time (such as per week or per month) Workforce: the number of workers/units of capacity needed for production Overtime: the amount of overtime production planned Machine Capacity Level: the number of units of machine capacity needed for production Subcontracting: the subcontracted capacity required over the planning horizon Backlog: demand not satisfied in the period in which it arises but carried over to future periods Inventory on Hand: the planned inventory carried over the various periods in the planning horizon The aggregate plan serves as a broad blueprint for operations and establishes the parameters within which short-term production and distribution decisions are made.\\nThe aggregate plan allows the supply chain to alter capacity allocations and change supply contracts.\\nAs mentioned in earlier chapters, the entire supply chain should be involved with the planning process.\\nIf a manufacturer has planned an increase in production over a given time period, the supplier, transporter, and warehouser must be aware of this plan and incorporate the increase into their  .\\nIdeally, all stages of the supply chain should work together on an aggregate plan that optimizes supply chain performance.\\nIf each stage develops its own aggregate plan independently, it is extremely unlikely that all the plans will mesh in a coordinated manner.\\nThis lack of coordination results in shortages or oversupply in the supply chain.\\nTherefore, it is important to form aggregate plans over a wide scope of the supply chain.\\nIn the next section, we formally define the aggregate planning problem.\\nWe specify the information required for aggregate planning and discuss the decision outcomes that aggregate planning can provide.\\nThe objective of the aggregate plan is to satisfy demand in a way that maximizes profit for the firm.\\nWe can state the aggregate planning problem formally as follows: Given the demand forecast for each period in the planning horizon, determine the production level, inventory level, capacity level (internal and outsourced), and any backlogs (unmet demand) for each period that maximize the firm\\'s profit over the planning horizon.\\nTo create an aggregate plan, a company must specify the planning horizon.\\nA planning horizon is the time period over which the aggregate plan is to produce a solution--usually between 3 and 18 months.\\nA company must also specify the duration of each period within the planning horizon (e.g., weeks, months, or quarters).\\nIn general, aggregate planning takes place over months or quarters.\\nNext, a company specifies key information required to produce an aggregate plan and to make the decisions for which the aggregate plan will develop recommendations.\\nThis information and the recommendations are specified for a generic aggregate planning problem in this section.\\nThe model we propose in the next section is flexible enough to accommodate situation-specific requirements.\\nAn aggregate planner requires the following information: ?Aggregate demand forecast Ft for each Period t in a planning horizon that extends over T periods ?Production costs ?Labor costs, regular time ($/hour), and overtime costs ($/hour) ?Cost of subcontracting production ($/unit or $/hour) ?Cost of changing capacity; specifically, cost of hiring/laying off workforce ($/worker) and cost of adding or reducing machine capacity ($/machine) ?Labor/machine hours required per unit ?Inventory holding cost ($/unit/period) ?Stockout or backlog cost ($/unit/period) ?Constraints ?Limits on overtime ?Limits on layoffs ?Limits on capital available ?Limits on stockouts and backlogs ?Constraints from suppliers to the enterprise Using this information, a company makes the following determinations through aggregate planning: Production Quantity from Regular Time, Overtime, and Subcontracted Time: used to determine number of workers and supplier purchase levels Inventory Held: used to determine the warehouse space and working capital required  .\\nBacklog/Stockout Quantity: used to determine customer service levels Workforce Hired/Laid Off: used to determine any labor issues likely to be encountered Machine Capacity Increase/Decrease: used to determine if new production equipment should be purchased or available equipment idled The quality of an aggregate plan has a significant impact on the profitability of a firm.\\nA poor aggregate plan can result in lost sales and lost profits if the available inventory and capacity are unable to meet demand.\\nA poor aggregate plan may also result in a large amount of excess inventory and capacity, thereby raising costs.\\nTherefore, aggregate planning is an important tool in helping a supply chain maximize profitability.\\nIdentifying Aggregate Units of Production An important first step in aggregate planning is the identification of a suitable aggregate unit of production.\\nWhile planning is done at the aggregate level, it is important that the aggregate unit be identified in a way that when the final production schedule is built (this has to be at the disaggregate product level), the results of the aggregate plan reflect approximately what can be accomplished in practice.\\nGiven that the bottleneck is likely to be the most constraining area in any manufacturing facility, it is important to focus on the bottleneck when selecting the aggregate unit and identifying capacity as well as production times.\\nWhen evaluating production times, it is also important to account for activities such as setups and maintenance that use up capacity but do not result in any production.\\nOtherwise, the aggregate plan will overestimate the production capacity available, resulting in a plan that cannot be implemented in practice.\\nWe now discuss a simple approach that can be used to identify aggregate units and also evaluate costs, revenues, and times for this aggregate unit.\\nConsider, for example, Red Tomato Tools, a manufacturer of gardening equipment with manufacturing facilities in Mexico.\\nThe company makes six product families at its manufacturing plant.\\nThe costs, revenues, production times, setup times, and historical batch sizes of production for each family are as shown in Table 8-1.\\nIn Table 8-1, the net production time per unit is obtained by adding the changeover time allocated to each unit and the production time.\\nThus, the net production time/unit for Family A is obtained as 8/50 + 5.60 = 5.76 hours.\\nA simple approach to defining the aggregate unit is based on the weighted average of the percentage of sales represented by each family.\\nSuch an approach is meaningful if management is relatively confident of the mix of sales and all the product families use roughly the same set of resources at a plant.\\nTaking this approach, the material cost per aggregate unit is obtained as (15 * 0.10) + (7 * 0.25) + (9 * 0.20) + (12 * 0.10) + (9 * 0.20) + (13 * 0.15) = $10.\\nUsing a similar evaluation, we obtain that the revenue per aggregate unit = $40 and the net production time per aggregate unit = 4.00 hours.\\nTable 8-1 Costs, Revenues, and Times at Red Tomato Tools  Family A B C D E F  Material Cost/ Unit ($) 15 7 9 12 9 13  Revenue/ Unit ($) 54 30 39 49 36 48  Setup Time/Batch (hour) 8 6 8 10 6 5  Average Batch Size 50 150 100 50 100 75  Production Time/ Unit (hour) 5.60 3.00 3.80 4.80 3.60 4.30  Net Production Time/Unit (hour) 5.76 3.04 3.88 5.00 3.66 4.37  Percentage Share of Units Sold 10 25 20 10 20 15  .\\nOther potential aggregate units could be tons of output (likely to be suitable for continuous flows such as gasoline or paper) or dollars of sales.\\nFor example, a paper mill might produce papers of different thickness and quality.\\nIf tons of output is used as the aggregate unit, all capacity, cost, and revenue calculations should account for the product mix.\\nThe aggregate planner must make trade-offs among capacity, inventory, and backlog costs.\\nAn aggregate plan that increases one of these costs typically results in reduction of the other two.\\nIn this sense, the costs represent a trade-off: To lower inventory cost, a planner must increase capacity cost or delay delivery to the customer.\\nThus, the planner trades inventory cost for capacity or backlog cost.\\nArriving at the most profitable combination of trade-offs is the goal of aggregate planning.\\nGiven that demand varies over time, the relative level of the three costs leads to one of them being the key lever the planner uses to maximize profits.\\nIf the cost of varying capacity is low, a company may not need to build inventory or carry backlogs.\\nIf the cost of varying capacity is high, a company may compensate by building some inventory and carrying some backlogs from peak demand periods to off-peak demand periods.\\nIn general, a company attempts to use a combination of the three costs to best meet demand.\\nTherefore, the fundamental trade-offs available to a planner are among ?Capacity (regular time, overtime, subcontracted) ?Inventory ?Backlog/lost sales because of delay There are essentially three distinct aggregate planning strategies for achieving balance among these costs.\\nThese strategies involve trade-offs among capital investment, workforce size, work hours, inventory, and backlogs/lost sales.\\nMost strategies that a planner actually uses are a combination of these three and are referred to as tailored or hybrid strategies.\\nThe three strategies are as follows: 1.\\nChase strategy--using capacity as the lever: With this strategy, the production rate is synchronized with the demand rate by varying machine capacity or hiring and laying off employees as the demand rate varies.\\nIn practice, achieving this synchronization can be problematic because of the difficulty of varying capacity and workforce on short notice.\\nThis strategy can be expensive to implement if the cost of varying machine or labor capacity over time is high.\\nIt can also have a significant negative impact on the morale of the workforce.\\nThe chase strategy results in low levels of inventory in the supply chain and high levels of change in capacity and workforce.\\nIt should be used when the cost of carrying inventory is high and costs to change levels of machine and labor capacity are low.\\nFlexibility strategy--using utilization as the lever: This strategy may be used if there is excess machine capacity (i.e., if machines are not used 24 hours a day, seven days a week) and the workforce shows scheduling flexibility.\\nIn this case, the workforce (capacity) is kept stable, but the number of hours worked is varied over time in an effort to synchronize production with demand.\\nA planner can use variable amounts of overtime or a flexible schedule to achieve this synchronization.\\nAlthough this strategy does require that the workforce be flexible, it avoids some of the problems associated with the chase strategy, most notably, changing the size of the workforce.\\nThis strategy results in low levels of inventory but with lower average machine utilization.\\nIt should be used when inventory carrying costs are relatively high and machine capacity is relatively inexpensive.\\nLevel strategy--using inventory as the lever: With this strategy, a stable machine capacity and workforce are maintained with a constant output rate.\\nShortages and surpluses result in inventory levels fluctuating over time.\\nIn this case, production is not synchronized with demand.\\nEither inventories are built up in anticipation of future demand or backlogs are carried  .\\nover from high- to low-demand periods.\\nEmployees benefit from stable working conditions.\\nA drawback associated with this strategy is that large inventories may accumulate and customer orders may be delayed.\\nThis strategy keeps capacity and costs of changing capacity relatively low.\\nIt should be used when inventory carrying and backlog costs are relatively low.\\nIn practice, a planner is most likely to come up with a tailored or hybrid strategy that combines aspects of all three approaches.\\nIn the next section, we discuss a methodology that is commonly used for aggregate planning.\\nAs we discussed earlier, the goal of aggregate planning is to maximize profit while meeting demand.\\nEvery company, in its effort to meet customer demand, faces certain constraints, such as the capacity of its facilities or a supplier\\'s ability to deliver a component.\\nA highly effective tool for a company to use when it tries to maximize profits while being subjected to a series of constraints is linear programming.\\nLinear programming finds the solution that creates the highest profit while satisfying the constraints that the company faces.\\nWe illustrate linear programming through the discussion of Red Tomato Tools, a small manufacturer of gardening equipment with manufacturing facilities in Mexico.\\nRed Tomato\\'s products are sold through retailers in the United States.\\nRed Tomato\\'s operations consist of the assembly of purchased parts into a multipurpose gardening tool.\\nBecause of the limited equipment and space required for its assembly operations, Red Tomato\\'s capacity is determined mainly by the size of its workforce.\\nFor this example, we use a six-month time period because this is a long enough time horizon to illustrate many of the main points of aggregate planning.\\nRed Tomato Tools The demand for Red Tomato\\'s gardening tools from consumers is highly seasonal, peaking in the spring as people plant their gardens.\\nThis seasonal demand ripples up the supply chain from the retailer to Red Tomato, the manufacturer.\\nThe options Red Tomato has for handling the seasonality are adding workers during the peak season, subcontracting out some of the work, building up inventory during the slow months, or building up a backlog of orders that will be delivered late to customers.\\nTo determine how to best use these options through an aggregate plan, Red Tomato\\'s vice president of supply chain starts with the first task--building a demand forecast.\\nAlthough Red Tomato could attempt to forecast this demand itself, a much more accurate forecast comes from a collaborative process used by both Red Tomato and its retailers to produce the forecast shown in Table 8-2.\\nIt is important that this demand account for the product mix that is expected to sell and be in terms of aggregate units defined earlier.\\nRed Tomato sells each tool through retailers for $40.\\nThe company has a starting inventory in January of 1,000 tools.\\nAt the beginning of January, the company has a workforce of 80 employees.\\nTable 8-2 Demand Forecast at Red Tomato Tools  Month  Demand Forecast  January February March April May June  1,600 3,000 3,200 3,800 2,200 2,200  .\\nTable 8-3 Costs for Red Tomato  Item  Cost  Material cost Inventory holding cost Marginal cost of stockout/backlog Hiring and training costs Layoff cost Labor hours required Regular time cost Overtime cost Cost of subcontracting  $10/unit $2/unit/month $5/unit/month $300/worker $500/worker 4/unit $4/hour $6/hour $30/unit  .\\nCurrently, Red Tomato has no limits on subcontracting, inventories, and stockouts/ backlog.\\nAll stockouts are backlogged and supplied from the following months\\' production.\\nInventory costs are incurred on the ending inventory in the month.\\nThe supply chain manager\\'s goal is to obtain the optimal aggregate plan that allows Red Tomato to end June with at least 500 units (i.e., no stockouts at the end of June and at least 500 units in inventory).\\nThe optimal aggregate plan is one that results in the highest profit over the six-month planning horizon.\\nFor now, given Red Tomato\\'s desire for a high level of customer service, assume all demand is to be met, although it can be met late.\\nTherefore, the revenues earned over the planning horizon are fixed.\\nAs a result, minimizing cost over the planning horizon is the same as maximizing profit.\\nIn many instances, a company has the option of not meeting certain demand, or price itself may be a variable that a company has to determine based on the aggregate plan.\\nIn such a scenario, minimizing cost is not equivalent to maximizing profits.\\nDecision Variables The first step in constructing an aggregate planning model is to identify the set of decision variables whose values are to be determined as part of the aggregate plan.\\nFor Red Tomato, the following decision variables are defined for the aggregate planning model: Wt = workforce size for Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ht = number of employees hired at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Lt = number of employees laid off at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Pt = number of units produced in Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 It = inventory at the end of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 St = number of units stocked out/backlogged at the end of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ct = number of units subcontracted for Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ot = number of overtime hours worked in Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 The next step in constructing an aggregate planning model is to define the objective function.\\nObjective Function Denote the demand in Period t by Dt.\\nThe values of Dt are as specified by the demand forecast in Table 8-2.\\nThe objective function is to minimize the total cost (equivalent to maximizing total profit as all demand is to be satisfied) incurred during the planning horizon.\\nThe cost incurred has the following components: ?Regular-time labor cost ?Overtime labor cost ?Cost of hiring and layoffs ?Cost of holding inventory ?Cost of stocking out ?Cost of subcontracting ?Material cost These costs are evaluated as follows: 1.\\nRegular-time labor cost.\\nRecall that workers are paid a regular-time wage of $640 ($4/hour * 8 hours/day * 20 days/month) per month.\\nBecause Wt is the number of workers in Period t, the regular-time labor cost over the planning horizon is given by 6 Regular-time labor cost = a 640Wt t=1 2.\\nAs overtime labor cost is $6 per hour (see Table 8-3) and Ot represents the number of overtime hours worked in Period t, the overtime cost over the planning horizon is 6 Overtime labor cost = a 6Ot t=1 3.\\nCost of hiring and layoffs.\\nThe cost of hiring a worker is $300 and the cost of laying off a worker is $500 (see Table 8-3).\\nHt and Lt represent the number hired and the number laid off, respectively, in Period t. Thus, the cost of hiring and layoff is given by 66 Cost of hiring and layoff = a 300Ht + a 500Lt t=1 t=1 4.\\nCost of inventory and stockout.\\nThe cost of carrying inventory is $2 per unit per month, and the cost of stocking out is $5 per unit per month (see Table 8-3).\\nIt and St represent the units in inventory and the units stocked out, respectively, in Period t. Thus, the cost of holding inventory and stocking out is 66 Cost of holding inventory and stocking out = a 2It + a 5St t=1 t=1 5.\\nCost of materials and subcontracting.\\nThe material cost is $10 per unit and the subcontracting cost is $30/unit (see Table 8-3).\\nPt represents the quantity produced and Ct represents the quantity subcontracted in Period t. Thus, the material and subcontracting cost is 66 Cost of materials and subcontracting = a 10Pt + a 30Ct t=1 t=1  .\\nThe total cost incurred during the planning horizon is the sum of all the aforementioned costs and is given by  6 66 6 6 a 640Wt + a 6Ot + a 300Ht + a 500Lt + a 2It t=1 t=1 t=1 t=1 t=1  66  6  + a 5St + a 10Pt + a 30Ct  t=1 t=1  t=1  .\\nThe values of the decision variables in the objective function cannot be set arbitrarily.\\nThey are subject to a variety of constraints defined by available capacity and operating policies.\\nThe next step in setting up the aggregate planning model is to define clearly the constraints linking the decision variables.\\nConstraints Red Tomato\\'s vice president must now specify the constraints that the decision variables must not violate.\\nThey are as follows:  1.\\nWorkforce, hiring, and layoff constraints.\\nThe workforce size Wt in Period t is obtained by adding the number hired Ht in Period t to the workforce size Wt-1 in Period t - 1, and subtracting the number laid off Lt in Period t as follows:  Wt = Wt-1 + Ht - Lt for t = 1, ?, 6  .\\nThe starting workforce size is given by W0 = 80.\\nCapacity constraints.\\nIn each period, the amount produced cannot exceed the available capacity.\\nThis set of constraints limits the total production by the total internally available capacity (which is determined based on the available labor hours, regular or overtime).\\nSubcontracted production is not included in this constraint because the constraint is limited to production within the plant.\\nAs each worker can produce 40 units per month on regular time (four hours per unit as specified in Table 8-3) and one unit for every four hours of overtime, we have the following:  Pt ... 40Wt  +  Ot 4  for t = 1, ?, 6  .\\nInventory balance constraints.\\nThe third set of constraints balances inventory at the end of each period.\\nNet demand for Period t is obtained as the sum of the current demand Dt and the previous backlog St-1.\\nThis demand is either filled from current production (in-house production Pt or subcontracted production Ct) and previous inventory It-1 (in which case some inventory It may be left over) or part of it is backlogged St.\\nThis relationship is captured by the following equation:  It-1 + Pt + Ct = Dt + St-1 + It - St for t = 1, ?, 6  .\\nThe starting inventory is given by I0 = 1,000, the ending inventory must be at least 500 units (i.e., I6 ?500), and initially there are no backlogs (i.e., S0 = 0).\\nOvertime limit constraints.\\nThe fourth set of constraints requires that no employee work more than 10 hours of overtime each month.\\nThis requirement limits the total amount of overtime hours available as follows:  Ot ... 10Wt for t = 1, ?, 6  .\\nIn addition, each variable must be nonnegative and there must be no backlog at the end of Period 6 (i.e., S6 = 0).\\nWhen implementing the model in Microsoft Excel, which we discuss later, it is easiest if all the constraints are written so that the right-hand side for each constraint is 0.\\nOt - 10Wt ... 0 for t = 1, ?, 6 Observe that one can easily add constraints that limit the amount purchased from subcontractors each month or the maximum number of employees to be hired or laid off.\\nAny other constraints limiting backlogs or inventories can also be accommodated.\\nIdeally, the number of employees hired or laid off should be integer variables.\\nFractional variables may be justified if some employees work for only part of a month.\\nSuch a linear program can be solved using the tool Solver in Excel.\\nIf we assume the average inventory in Period t to be the average of the starting and ending inventories, that is, 1It-1 + It2>2, the average inventory over the planning horizon is given by  1I0 + IT2>2 + a a tT=-11It b  Average inventory =  T  The average time that units spend in inventory over the planning horizon is obtained using Little\\'s law (average flow time = average inventory/throughput).\\nThe average time in inventory  is given as  Average time in inventory  =  (I0 J  +  IT)>2  + T  a a Tt =-11It b ?a a tT=-11Dt b KJ T K  .\\nFor this aggregate plan we have the following: Total cost over planning horizon = $422,660 Red Tomato lays off a total of 16 employees at the beginning of January.\\nAfter that, the company maintains the workforce and production level.\\nThey use the subcontractor during  Table 8-4 Aggregate Plan for Red Tomato  Period, t 0 1 2 3 4 5 6  No.\\nHired, Ht 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  No.\\nLaid Off, Lt 0 16 0 0 0 0 0  Workforce Size, Wt 80 64

2,560 2,560  .\\nThey carry a backlog only from April to May.\\nIn all other months, they plan no stockouts.\\nIn fact, Red Tomato carries inventory in all other periods.\\nWe describe this inventory as seasonal inventory because it is carried in anticipation of a future increase in demand.\\nGiven the sale price of $40 per unit and total sales of 16,000 units, revenue over the planning horizon is given by Revenue over planning horizon = 40 * 16,000 = $640,000 The average seasonal inventory during the planning horizon is given by  (I0  +  I6) n 2  +  aa  5 t=  1Itb  5,250  Average seasonal inventory =  = = 875  T6  .\\nAverage flow time = 875 = 0.33 = 0.33 months 2,667  If the seasonal fluctuation of demand grows, synchronization of supply and demand becomes more difficult, resulting in an increase in either inventory or backlogs as well as an increase in the total cost to the supply chain.\\nThis is illustrated in Example 8-1, in which the demand forecast is more variable.\\nEXAMPLE 8-1 Impact of Higher Demand Variability All the data are exactly the same as in our previous discussion of Red Tomato, except for the demand forecast.\\nAssume that the same overall demand (16,000 units) is distributed over the six months in such a way that the seasonal fluctuation of demand is higher, as shown in Table 8-5.\\nObtain the optimal aggregate plan in this case.\\nAnalysis: In this case, the optimal aggregate plan (using the same costs as those used before) is shown in Table 8-6.\\nObserve that monthly production remains the same, but both inventories and stockouts (backlogs) go up compared to the aggregate plan in Table 8-4 for the demand profile in Table 8-2.\\nThe cost of meeting the new demand profile in Table 8-5 is higher at $433,080 (compared to $422,660 for the previous demand profile in Table 8-2).\\nTable 8-5 Demand Forecast with Higher Seasonal Fluctuation  Month  Demand Forecast  January February March April May June  1,000 3,000 3,800 4,800 2,000 1,400

Example 8-1, we can see that the increase in demand variability at the retailer increases seasonal inventory as well as planned costs.\\nUsing the Red Tomato example, we also see that the optimal trade-off changes as the costs change.\\nThis is illustrated in Example 8-2, in which we show that as the costs of hiring and layoff decrease, it is better to vary capacity with demand while having less inventory and backlogs.\\nEXAMPLE 8-2 Impact of Lower Costs of Hiring and Layoff Assume that demand at Red Tomato is as shown in Table 8-2, and all other data are the same except that the costs of hiring and layoff are now $50 each.\\nEvaluate the total cost corresponding to the aggregate plan in Table 8-4.\\nSuggest an optimal aggregate plan for the new cost structure.\\nAnalysis: If the costs of hiring and layoff decrease to $50 each, the cost corresponding to the aggregate plan in Table 8-4 decreases from $422,660 to $412,780.\\nTaking this new cost into account and determining a new optimal aggregate plan yields the plan shown in Table 8-7.\\nObserve that the workforce size fluctuates between a high of 87 and a low of 45, as opposed to being stable at 64 as in Table 8-4.\\nAs expected, the workforce size is varied (because the cost of varying capacity has decreased) while inventory and stockouts have decreased compared to the aggregate plan in Table 8-4.\\nThe total cost of the aggregate plan in Table 8-7 is $412,780, compared to $422,660 (for the aggregate plan in Table 8-4) if the cost of hiring and layoff is $50 each.\\nTable 8-7 Optimal Aggregate Plan for Hiring

planning horizon is given by Seasonal inventory = [(I0 + IT)>2] + a Tt=-11It = 2,450 = 408 T6 .\\nAverage flow time = 408 = 0.15 months 2,667 From Example 8-2, observe that increasing volume flexibility (by decreasing the cost of hiring and layoff) not only decreases the total cost but also shifts the optimal balance toward using the volume flexibility while carrying lower inventories and allowing less stockout.\\nForecast Error in Aggregate Plans The aggregate planning methodology we have discussed in this chapter does not take into account any forecast error.\\nHowever, we know that all forecasts have errors.\\nTo improve the quality of these aggregate plans, forecast errors must be considered.\\nForecasting errors are dealt with using either safety inventory, defined as inventory held to satisfy demand that is higher than forecasted (discussed thoroughly in Chapter 12), or safety capacity, defined as capacity used to satisfy demand that is higher than forecasted.\\nA company can create a buffer for forecast error using safety inventory and safety capacity in a variety of ways, some of which are listed next: ?Use overtime as a form of safety capacity.\\n?Carry extra workforce permanently as a form of safety capacity.\\n?Use subcontractors as a form of safety capacity.\\n?Build and carry extra inventories as a form of safety inventory.\\n?Purchase capacity or product from an open or spot market as a form of safety capacity.\\nIn the next section, we explain how to implement the linear programming methodology for aggregate planning using Microsoft Excel.\\nWt = workforce size for Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ht = number of employees hired at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Lt = number of employees laid off at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Pt = number of units produced in Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 It = inventory at the end of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 St = number of units stocked out at the end of Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ct = number of units subcontracted for Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Ot = number of overtime hours worked in Month t, t = 1, .\\n, 6 Figure 8-1 illustrates what this table should look like.\\nThe decision variables are contained in cells B5 to I10, with each cell corresponding to a decision variable.\\nFor example, cell D7 corresponds to the workforce size in Period 3.\\nBegin by setting all the decision variables to 0 as shown in Figure 8-1.\\nAlso note that column J contains the actual demand.\\nThe demand information is included because it is required to calculate the aggregate plan.\\nEach constraint will eventually be written in Solver as Cell value {..., =, or 琫 0 In our case, we have constraints M5:M10 = 0, N5:N10 ?0, O5:O10 = 0, P5:P10 ?0 The third step is to create a cell containing the objective function, which is how each solution is judged.\\nThis cell need not contain the entire formula but can be written as a .\\nCell  Cell Formula  Equation  M5 =D5 - D4 - B5 + C5  .\\nN5 =40*D5 + E5/4 -I5  .\\nO5 =F4-G4+I5+H5-J5-F5+G5  .\\nCopied to M6:M10 N6:N10 O6:O10 P6:P10  formula using cells with intermediate cost calculations.\\nFor the Red Tomato example, the spreadsheet area for cost calculations is shown in Figure 8-3.\\nCell B15, for instance, contains the hiring costs incurred in Period 1.\\nThe formula in cell B15 is the product of cell B5 and the cell containing the hiring cost per worker, which is obtained from Table 8-3.\\nOther cells are filled similarly.\\nCell C22 contains the sum of cells B15 to I20, representing the total cost.\\nThe fourth step is to use Data | Analysis | Solver to invoke Solver.\\nWithin the Solver Parameters dialog box, enter the following information to represent the linear programming model: Set Target Cell: C22 Equal to: Select Min By Changing Cells: B5:I10 Subject to the constraints: B5:C10  integer {Number of workers hired or laid off is integer} B5:I10 ?0 {All decision variables are nonnegative} F10

should be returned.\\nIf Solver does not return the optimal solution, solve the problem again after saving the solution that Solver has returned.\\n(In some cases, multiple repetitions of this step may be required because of some flaws in the version of Solver that comes with Excel.\\nAdd-ins are available at relatively low cost that do not have any of these issues.)\\nThe optimal solution turns out to be the one shown in Table 8-4. .\\nConsider the aggregate plan in Table 8-4.\\nThe plan calls for a workforce of 64 and a production of 2,560 aggregate units in Period 1.\\nWe know that the production constraint is feasible at the aggregate level, but we will need to check feasibility at the disaggregate level.\\nThe first step is to divide the production quantity of 2,560 across the six families.\\nWe do so in the ratio of expected sales as shown in Table 8-8.\\nThus, the plan is to produce 256 units of Family A in Period 1 because it represents 10 percent of sales.\\nThe next step is to identify the number of planned batches for each family.\\nTo get feasibility of the plan, we divide the planned production quantity by the average batch size and the round the answer down.\\nFor Family A, the planned number of setups (batches) is thus 256/50 = 5.12 rounded down, which equals 5.\\nAs a result, the average batch size of Family A produced in this period will be larger than 50 (about 51).\\nWe similarly obtain the planned number of setups (batches) for each of the other families in Period 1 as shown in Table 8-8.\\nTo check the feasibility of the planned schedule, we calculate the setup time and the production time for the planned number of  .\\nTable 8-8 Disaggregating the Aggregate Plan at Red Tomato Tools for Period 1  Family  Setup Time/Batch (hour)  Average

5 5 5 5  40 24 40 50 30 25  Production Time (hours) .\\nbatches and units of each product family.\\nFrom Table 8-8, the total planned production and setup time is 10,231.4 hours (209 for setup + 10,022.4 for production).\\nGiven the 64 people planned, the available production time in the period is 64 * 160 = 10,240 hours.\\nThe planned schedule thus seems feasible.\\nAggregate planning is arguably the supply chain area in which information technology has been used the most.\\nThe earliest IT supply chain products were aggregate planning modules, often called factory, production, or manufacturing planning.\\nSome of the early modules focused only on obtaining a feasible production plan subject to constraints arising from demand and available capacity.\\nLater modules provided tools that chose an optimal solution from among the feasible production plans, based on objectives such as increased output or lowered cost.\\nThese classic solutions generally formulated the aggregate planning problem as a linear program (LP) to get a production schedule of products to be made in each period of time.\\nToday, some planning modules incorporate nonlinear optimization to account for the fact that not all constraints or reasonable objective functions are linear functions.\\nHowever, given the large amount of data considered in producing aggregate plans, which can render nonlinear problems computationally prohibitive, and the ability to create linear approximations of nonlinear functions, linear programming is often the best way to solve these problems.\\nSupply chain planning modules today often combine both production planning and inventory planning.\\nThe supply chain planning module uses the output of the forecasting module as a constraint in setting up the production schedule and inventory levels.\\nThese production schedules and inventory levels are used by the execution system for the actual production of the goods and the setting of inventory levels throughout the supply chain.\\nGiven the complexity of the problem, aggregate planning modules can add significant value even for small companies.\\nIT can add value in the aggregate planning realm along a number of dimensions: ?The ability to handle large problems ?The ability to handle complex problems (through either nonlinear optimization or linear approximations) ?The ability to interact with other core IT systems such as inventory management and sourcing Because aggregate planning problems are so complex, there is often no other way to arrive at a feasible solution than through IT.\\nMajor software players in this area include the ERP software firms (SAP and Oracle) and a variety of other vendors who often specialize their planning software by industry verticals.\\nIn the last decade, SAP and Oracle have come to dominate this space with specialized vendors finding it harder to survive.\\nThink beyond the enterprise to the entire supply chain.\\nMost aggregate planning today takes only the enterprise as its breadth of scope.\\nHowever, many factors outside the enterprise and throughout the supply chain can affect the optimal aggregate plan dramatically.\\nTherefore, avoid the trap of thinking only about your enterprise when planning.\\nWork with downstream partners to produce forecasts, with upstream partners to determine constraints, and with any other supply chain entities that can improve the quality of the inputs into the aggregate plan.\\nThe plan is only as good as the quality of the inputs.\\nSo using the supply chain to increase the quality of the inputs will greatly improve the quality of the aggregate plan.\\nAlso make sure to communicate the aggregate plan to all supply chain partners who will be affected by it.\\nMake plans flexible, because forecasts are always inaccurate.\\nAggregate plans are based on forecasts of future demand.\\nGiven that these forecasts are always inaccurate to some degree, the aggregate plan needs to have some flexibility built into it if it is to be useful.\\nBy building flexibility into the plan, when future demand changes, or other changes occur such as increases in costs, the plan can adjust appropriately to handle the new situation.\\nHow do we create this flexibility?\\nIn addition to the suggestions earlier in the chapter, we recommend that a manager perform sensitivity analysis on the inputs into an aggregate plan.\\nFor example, if the plan recommends expanding expensive capacity while facing uncertain demand, examine the outcome of a new aggregate plan when demand is higher and lower than expected.\\nIf this examination reveals a small savings from expanding capacity when demand is high but a large increase in cost when demand is lower than expected, deciding to postpone the capacity investment decision is a potentially attractive option.\\nUsing sensitivity analysis on the inputs into the aggregate plan enables a planner to choose the best solution for the range of possibilities that could occur.\\nRerun the aggregate plan as new data emerge.\\nAs we have mentioned, aggregate plans provide a map for the next 3 to 18 months.\\nThis does not mean that a firm should run aggregate plans only once every 3 to 18 months.\\nAs inputs such as demand forecasts change, managers should use the latest values of these inputs and rerun the aggregate plan.\\nBy using the latest inputs, the plan will avoid suboptimization based on old data and will produce a better solution.\\nUse aggregate planning as capacity utilization increases.\\nSurprisingly, many companies do not create aggregate plans and instead rely solely on orders from their distributors or warehouses to determine their production schedules.\\nThese orders are driven either by actual demand or through inventory management algorithms.\\nIf a company has no trouble meeting demand efficiently this way, then the lack of aggregate planning may not harm the company significantly.\\nHowever, when utilization becomes high and capacity is an issue, relying on orders to set the production schedule can lead to capacity problems.\\nWhen utilization is high, the likelihood of producing for all the orders as they arrive is low.\\nPlanning needs to be done to best utilize the capacity to meet the forecasted demand.\\nTherefore, as capacity utilization increases, it becomes more important to perform aggregate planning.\\nIdentify the decisions that are best solved by aggregate planning.\\nAggregate planning is best used to determine capacity, production, and inventory decisions for each period of time over a range of 3 to 18 months.\\nIt is most important to perform aggregate planning when capacity is limited and lead times are long.\\nUnderstand the importance of aggregate planning as a supply chain activity.\\nAggregate planning has a significant impact on supply chain performance and must be viewed as an activity that involves all supply chain partners.\\nAn aggregate plan prepared by an enterprise in isolation is not very useful because it does not take into account all requirements of the customer stage and constraints from the supplier stage.\\nLocalized aggregate planning cannot do a good job of matching supply and demand.\\nGood aggregate planning is done in collaboration with both customers and suppliers because accurate input is required from both stages.\\nThe quality of these inputs, in terms of both the demand forecast to be met and the constraints to be dealt with, determines the quality of the aggregate plan.\\nThe results of the aggregate plan must also be shared across the supply chain because they influence activities for both customers and suppliers.\\nFor suppliers, the aggregate plan determines anticipated orders; for customers, the aggregate plan determines planned supply.\\nDescribe the information needed to produce an aggregate plan.\\nTo create an aggregate plan, a planner needs a demand forecast, cost and production information, and any supply constraints.\\nThe demand forecast consists of an estimate of demand for each period of time in the planning horizon.\\nThe production and cost data consist of capacity levels and costs to raise and lower them, production costs, costs to store the product, costs of stocking out the product, and any restrictions that limit these factors.\\nSupply constraints determine limits on outsourcing, overtime, or materials.\\nExplain the basic trade-offs to consider when creating an aggregate plan.\\nThe basic trade-offs involve balancing the cost of capacity, the cost of inventory, and the cost of stockouts to maximize profitability.\\nIncreasing any one of the three allows the planner to lower the other two.\\nFormulate and solve aggregate planning problems using Microsoft Excel.\\nAggregate planning problems can be solved in Excel by setting up cells for the objective function and the constraints and using the Solver to produce the solution.\\n Manage supply to improve synchronization in a supply chain in the face of predictable variability.\\nManage demand to improve synchronization in a supply chain in the face of predictable variability.\\nUse sales and operations planning to maximize profitability when faced with predictable variability in a supply chain.\\nIn Chapter 8, we discussed how companies manage supply by using aggregate planning to make optimal tradeoffs in a way that maximizes profits.\\nIn this chapter, we build on the knowledge we gained from Chapter 8 and continue to expand our scope beyond the enterprise to the supply chain as we deal with predictable variability of demand.\\nWe also discuss how demand may be managed to counter predictable variability through the use of price and promotion.\\nBy managing supply and demand together, managers can maximize overall profitability of a supply chain.\\nPredictable variability is change in demand that can be forecasted.\\nProducts that undergo this type of change in demand create numerous problems in the supply chain, ranging from high levels of stockouts during peak demand periods to high levels of excess inventory during periods of low demand.\\nThese problems increase the costs and decrease the responsiveness of the supply chain.\\nSupply and demand management through sales and operations planning (S&OP) can significantly improve performance when applied to predictably variable products.\\nFaced with predictable variability, a company\\'s goal is to respond in a manner that balances supply with demand to maximize profitability.\\nThe goal of sales and operations planning is to appropriately combine two broad options to handle predictable variability: 1.\\nManage supply using capacity, inventory, subcontracting, and backlogs.\\nManage demand using short-term price discounts and promotions.\\nThe use of these tools enables the supply chain to increase profitability, because supply and demand are matched in a more coordinated fashion.\\nTo illustrate some of the issues involved, let us consider the garden equipment manufacturer discussed in Chapter 8, Red Tomato Tools.\\nDemand for garden tools is seasonal, with sales concentrated in the spring.\\nRed Tomato must plan how it will meet the demand to maximize profit.\\nOne way requires Red Tomato to carry enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand from production in any period.\\nThe advantage of this approach is that Red Tomato incurs low inventory costs because no inventory is carried from period to period.\\nThe disadvantage, however, is that much of the expensive capacity is unused during most months, when demand is lower.\\nAnother approach to meeting demand is to build up inventory during the off-season to keep production stable year round.\\nThe advantage of this approach lies in the fact that Red Tomato can get by with a lower capacity, less expensive factory.\\nHigh inventory carrying costs, however, make this alternative expensive.\\nA third approach is for Red Tomato to work with its retail partners in the supply chain to offer a price promotion before the spring months, during periods of low demand.\\nThis promotion shifts some of the spring demand forward into a slow period, thereby spreading demand more evenly throughout the year and reducing the seasonal surge.\\nSuch a demand pattern is less expensive to supply.\\nRed Tomato needs to decide which alternative maximizes its profitability through its S&OP process.\\nOften companies divide the task of supply and demand management into different functions.\\nSales typically manages demand, while operations manages supply.\\nAt a higher level, supply chains suffer from this phenomenon as well, with retailers managing demand independently and manufacturers managing supply independently.\\nLack of coordination hurts supply chain profits when supply and demand management decisions are made independently.\\nTherefore, supply chain partners must work together across enterprises to coordinate these decisions and maximize profitability.\\nThe S&OP process facilitates such coordination.\\nWe illustrate the value of this coordination through further discussion of Red Tomato.\\nFirst, we focus on actions that a supply chain can take to improve profitability by managing supply.\\nA firm can vary supply of product by controlling a combination of the following two factors: 1.\\nProduction capacity 2.\\nInventory The objective is to maximize profit, which, for our discussion, is the difference between revenue generated from sales and the total cost associated with material, capacity, and inventory.\\nIn general, companies use a combination of varying capacity and inventory to manage supply.\\nIn the following sections, we list some specific approaches to managing capacity and inventory with the goal of maximizing profits.\\nManaging Capacity In managing capacity to meet predictable variability, firms use a combination of the following approaches: ?Time flexibility from workforce: In this approach, a firm uses flexible work hours by the workforce to manage capacity to better meet demand.\\nIn many instances, plants do not  .\\noperate continually and are left idle during portions of the day or week.\\nTherefore, spare plant capacity exists in the form of hours when the plant is not operational.\\nFor example, many plants do not run three shifts, so the existing workforce could work overtime during peak periods to produce more to meet demand.\\nThe overtime is varied to match the fluctuation in demand.\\nThis system allows production from the plant to match demand from customers more closely.\\nIf demand fluctuates by day of the week or week of the month and the workforce is willing to be flexible, a firm can schedule the workforce so that the available capacity matches demand better.\\nIn such settings, use of a part-time workforce can further increase capacity flexibility by enabling the firm to put more people to work during peak periods.\\nTelemarketing centers and banks use part-time workers extensively to match supply and demand better.\\n?Use of seasonal workforce: In this approach, a firm uses a temporary workforce during the peak season to increase capacity to match demand.\\nThe tourism industry often uses seasonal workers.\\nA base of full-time employees exists, and more are hired only for the peak season.\\nToyota regularly uses a seasonal workforce in Japan to match supply and demand better.\\nThis approach, however, may be hard to sustain if the labor market is tight.\\n?Use of subcontracting: In this approach, a firm subcontracts peak production so that internal production remains level and can be done cheaply.\\nWith the subcontractor handling the peaks, the company is able to build a relatively inflexible but low-cost facility in which production rates are kept relatively constant (other than variations from the use of overtime).\\nPeaks are subcontracted out to facilities that are more flexible.\\nA key here is the availability of relatively flexible subcontractor capacity.\\nThe subcontractor can often provide flexibility at a lower cost by pooling the fluctuations in demand across different manufacturers.\\nThus, the flexible subcontractor capacity must have both volume (fluctuating demand from a manufacturer) as well as variety flexibility (demand from several manufacturers) to be sustainable.\\nFor example, most power companies do not have the capacity to supply their customers with all the electricity demanded on peak days.\\nThey instead rely on being able to purchase power from suppliers and subcontractors who have excess electricity.\\nThis allows the power companies to maintain a level supply and, consequently, a lower cost.\\n?Use of dual facilities--specialized and flexible: In this approach, a firm builds both specialized and flexible facilities.\\nSpecialized facilities produce a relatively stable output of products over time in an efficient manner.\\nFlexible facilities produce a widely varying volume and variety of products but at a higher unit cost.\\nFor instance, a PC components manufacturer might have specialized facilities for each type of circuit board as well as a flexible facility that can manufacture all types of circuit boards.\\nEach specialized facility can produce at a relatively steady rate, with fluctuations being absorbed by the flexible facility.\\n?Designing product flexibility into the production processes: In this approach, a firm has flexible production lines whose production rate can easily be varied.\\nProduction is then changed to match demand.\\nHino Trucks in Japan has several production lines for different product families.\\nThe production lines are designed so that changing the number of workers on a line can vary the production rate.\\nAs long as variation of demand across different product lines is complementary (i.e., when one goes up, the other tends to go down), the capacity on each line can be varied by moving the workforce from one line to another.\\nOf course, this requires that the workforce be multiskilled and able to adapt easily to being moved from line to line.\\nProduction flexibility can also be achieved if the production machinery is flexible and can be changed easily from producing one product to producing another.\\nThis approach is effective only if the overall demand across all the products is relatively constant.\\nSeveral firms that produce products with seasonal demand try to exploit this approach by carrying a portfolio of products that have peak demand seasons distributed over the year.\\nA classic example is that of a lawn mower manufacturer that also manufactures snowblowers to maintain a steady demand on its factory throughout the year.\\nIn the services field, an example comes from strategy consulting firms,  .\\nwhich often offer a balanced product portfolio, with growth strategies emphasized when economic times are good and cost-cutting projects emphasized when times are bad.\\nManaging Inventory When managing inventory to meet predictable variability, firms use a combination of the following approaches: ?Using common components across multiple products: In this approach, a firm designs common components to be used in multiple products.\\nThe total demand of these components is relatively stable, even though each product displays predictable variability.\\nThe use of a common engine for both lawn mowers and snowblowers allows for engine demand to be relatively stable even though lawn mower and snowblower demand fluctuates over the year.\\nTherefore, the part of the supply chain that produces components can easily synchronize supply with demand, and a relatively low inventory of parts has to be built up.\\nSimilarly, in a consulting firm, many of the same consultants produce growth strategies when they are in demand and cost-reduction strategies when these are in demand.\\n?Build inventory of high-demand or predictable-demand products: When most of the products a firm produces have the same peak demand season, the previous approach is not feasible.\\nIn such an environment, it is best for the firm to build products that have more predictable demand during the off-season, because there is less to be learned about their demand by waiting.\\nProduction of more uncertain items should take place closer to the selling season, when demand is more predictable.\\nConsider a manufacturer of winter jackets that produces jackets both for retail sale and for the Boston Police and Fire Departments.\\nDemand for the Boston Police and Fire jackets is more predictable, and these jackets can be made in the off-season and stocked up until winter.\\nThe retail jacket\\'s demand, however, will likely be better known closer to the time when it is sold, because fashion trends can change quickly.\\nTherefore, the manufacturer should produce the retail jackets close to the peak season, when demand is easier to predict.\\nThis strategy helps the supply chain synchronize supply and demand better.\\nNext we consider actions a supply chain can take to improve profitability by managing demand.\\nSupply chains can influence demand by using pricing and other forms of promotion.\\nPromotion decisions are often made by retailers without taking into account the impact on the rest of the supply chain.\\nIn this section, our goal is to show how supply chain members can collaborate on pricing and aggregate planning (both demand and supply management) decisions to maximize supply chain profitability.\\nLet us return to Red Tomato Tools, the garden equipment manufacturer.\\nGreen Thumb Gardens is a large retail chain that has signed an exclusive contract to sell all products made by Red Tomato Tools.\\nDemand for garden tools peaks in the spring months of March and April as gardeners prepare to begin planting.\\nIn planning, the goal of both firms should be to maximize supply chain profits because this outcome leaves them more money to share.\\nFor profit maximization to take place, Red Tomato and Green Thumb need to devise a way to collaborate and, just as important, determine a way to split the supply chain profits.\\nDetermining how these profits will be allocated to different members of the supply chain is key to successful collaboration.\\nRed Tomato and Green Thumb are exploring how the timing of retail promotions affects profitability.\\nAre they in a better position if they offer the price promotion during the peak period of demand or during a low-demand period?\\nGreen Thumb\\'s vice president of sales favors a promotion during the peak period because this increases revenue by the largest amount.\\nIn contrast, Red Tomato\\'s vice president of manufacturing is against such a move because it increases manufacturing costs.\\nShe favors a promotion during the low-demand season because it levels demand and lowers production costs.\\nS&OP allows the two to collaborate and make the optimal trade-offs.\\nThe Base Case We start by considering the base case that has already been discussed in Chapter 8.\\nEach tool has a retail price of $40.\\nRed Tomato ships assembled tools to Green Thumb, where all inventory is held.\\nGreen Thumb has a starting inventory in January of 1,000 tools.\\nAt the beginning of January, Red Tomato has a workforce of 80 employees at its manufacturing facility in Mexico.\\nThere are a total of 20 working days in each month, and Red Tomato workers earn the equivalent of $4 per hour.\\nEach employee works eight hours on normal time and the rest on overtime.\\nBecause the Red Tomato operation consists mostly of hand assembly, the capacity of the production operation is determined primarily by the total labor hours worked (i.e., it is not limited by machine capacity).\\nNo employee works more than 10 hours of overtime per month.\\nThe various costs are shown in Table 9-1.\\nThere are no limits on subcontracting, inventories, and stockouts.\\nAll stockouts are backlogged and supplied from the following month\\'s production.\\nInventory costs are incurred on the ending inventory in each month.\\nThe companies\\' goal is to obtain the optimal aggregate plan that leaves at least 500 units of inventory at the end of June (i.e., no stockouts at the end of June and at least 500 units in inventory).\\nThe base demand forecast is shown in cells J5:J10 of Figure 9-1.\\nTable 9-1 Costs for Red Tomato and Green Thumb  Item  Cost  Material cost Inventory holding cost Marginal cost of a stockout Hiring and training costs Layoff cost Labor hours required Regular-time cost Overtime cost Cost of subcontracting  $10/unit $2/unit/month $5/unit/month $300/worker $500/worker 4/unit $4/hour $6/hour $30/unit  .\\nAll figures and analysis in this chapter come from the spreadsheet Chapter8,9-examples.xlsm (available from www.pearsonhighered.com/chopra).\\nFor the base case, we set cell E24 to 0 (no promotion) and use Solver.\\nThe optimal base case aggregate plan for Red Tomato and Green Thumb is shown in Figure 9-1 (this is the same as discussed in Chapter 8 and shown in Table 8-3).\\nFor the base case aggregate plan, the supply chain obtains the following costs and revenues:  Total cost over planning horizon = $422,660 Revenue over planning horizon = $640,000 Profit over the planning horizon = $217,340  The average seasonal inventory during the planning horizon is given by  Average seasonal inventory =  [1I0 +  I62> 2]  +  a  5 t=  1It  =  5,250  = 875  T6  The average flow time for this aggregate plan over the planning horizon is  average inventory  Average flow time =  =  875  = 0.33 months  average sales  2,667  Factors Influencing the Timing of a Promotion Four key factors influence the timing of a promotion: ?Impact of the promotion on demand ?Cost of holding inventory ?Cost of changing the level of capacity ?Product margins Management at both companies wants to identify whether each factor favors offering a promotion during the high- or low-demand periods.\\nThey start by considering the impact of promotion on demand.\\nWhen a promotion is offered during a period, that period\\'s demand tends to go up.\\nThis increase in demand results from a combination of the following three factors: 1.\\nMarket growth: An increase in consumption of the product occurs either from new or existing customers.\\nFor example, when Toyota offers a price promotion on the Camry, it may attract buyers who were considering the purchase of a lower-end model.\\nThus, the promotion increases the size of the overall family sedan market as well as increasing Toyota\\'s sales.\\nStealing share: Customers substitute the firm\\'s product for a competitor\\'s product.\\nWhen Toyota offers a Camry promotion, buyers who might have purchased a Honda Accord may now purchase a Camry.\\nThus, the promotion increases Toyota\\'s sales while keeping the overall size of the family sedan market the same.\\nForward buying: Customers move up future purchases (as discussed in Chapter 11) to the present.\\nA promotion may attract buyers who would have purchased a Camry a few months down the road.\\nForward buying does not increase Toyota\\'s sales in the long run and also leaves the family sedan market the same size.\\nThe first two factors increase the overall demand for Toyota, whereas forward buying simply shifts future demand to the present.\\nIt is important to understand the relative impact from the three factors as a result of a promotion before making a decision regarding the optimal  .\\ntiming of the promotion.\\nIn general, as the fraction of increased demand coming from forward buying grows, offering the promotion during the peak demand period becomes less attractive.\\nOffering a promotion during a peak period that has significant forward buying creates even more variable demand than before the promotion.\\nProduct that was once demanded in the slow period is now demanded in the peak period, making this demand pattern even more costly to serve.\\nWhen to Promote: Peak or Off-Peak?\\nGreen Thumb estimates that discounting a Red Tomato tool from $40 to $39 (a $1 discount) in any period results in the period demand increasing by 10 percent because of increased consumption or substitution.\\nFurther, 20 percent of each of the two following months\\' demand is moved forward.\\nManagement would like to determine whether it is more effective to offer the discount in January or April.\\nWe analyze the two options by considering the impact of a promotion on demand and the resulting optimal aggregate plan.\\nIMPACT OF OFFERING A PROMOTION IN JANUARY The team first considers the impact of offering the discount in January.\\nTo simulate this option in the spreadsheet Chapter8,9-examples.\\nxlsm, enter 1 in cell E24 (this sets promotion to be on) and 1 in cell E25 (this sets the promotion in Period 1, i.e., January).\\nThe new forecast accounts for the fact that consumption will increase by 10 percent in January and 20 percent of the demand from February and March is moved forward to January.\\nThus, with a January promotion, the new demand forecast for January is obtained by adjusting the base case demand from Figure 9-1 and is given by 1,600  1.1  0.2 ?\\n(3,000  3,200)  3,000.\\nThe new demand forecast for February is 3,000 ?0.8  2,400, and the new demand forecast for March is 3,200 ?0.8  2,560.\\nFor a January discount, the demand forecast is as shown in cells J5:J10 of Figure 9-2.\\nThe optimal aggregate plan is obtained by running Solver in the spreadsheet and is shown in Figure 9-2.\\nWith a discount in January, the supply chain obtains the following: Total cost over planning horizon = $422,080 Revenue over palnning horizon = $643,400 Profit over planning horizon = $221,320 Compared to the base case, offering a discount in January results in lower seasonal inventory, a somewhat lower total cost, and a higher total profit.\\nIMPACT OF OFFERING A PROMOTION IN APRIL Now management considers the impact of offering the discount in April.\\nTo simulate this option in the spreadsheet Chapter8,9-examples.xlsm, enter 1 in cell E24 (this sets promotion to be on) and 4 in cell E25 (this sets the promotion .\\nin period 4, i.e., April).\\nIf Green Thumb offers the discount in April, the demand forecast is as shown in cells J5:J10 of Figure 9-3.\\nThe optimal aggregate plan is obtained by running Solver and is shown in Figure 9-3.\\nCompared to discounting in January (Figure 9-2), discounting in April requires more capacity (in terms of workforce) and leads to a greater buildup of seasonal inventory and larger stockouts because of the big jump in demand in April.\\nWith a discount in April we have the following: Total cost over planning horizon = $438,920 Revenue over palnning horizon = $650,140 Profit over planning horizon = $211,220 Observe that a price promotion in January results in a higher supply chain profit, whereas a promotion in April results in a lower supply chain profit, compared to the base case of not running a promotion.\\nAs a result of the S&OP process, Red Tomato and Green Thumb decide to offer the discount in the off-peak month of January.\\nEven though revenues are higher when the discount is offered in April, the increase in operating costs makes it a less profitable option.\\nA promotion in January allows Red Tomato and Green Thumb to increase the profit they can share.\\nNote that this analysis is possible only because the retailer and manufacturer have an S&OP process that facilitates collaboration during the planning phase.\\nThis conclusion supports our earlier statement that it is not appropriate for a supply chain to leave pricing decisions solely in the domain of retailers and aggregate planning solely in the domain of manufacturers, with each having individual forecasts.\\nIt is crucial that forecasts, pricing, and aggregate planning be coordinated in a supply chain.\\nThe importance of a collaborative S&OP process is further supported by the fact that the optimal action is different if most of the demand increase comes from market growth or stealing market share rather than forward buying.\\nWe now illustrate the scenario in which a discount leads to a large increase in consumption.\\nWhen to Offer a Promotion if Discount Leads to a Large Increase in Consumption Reconsider the situation in which discounting a unit from $40 to $39 results in the period demand increasing by 100 percent (instead of the 10 percent considered in the previous analysis) because of increased consumption or substitution.\\nFurther, 20 percent of each of the two following months\\' demand is moved forward.\\nThe supply chain team wants to determine whether it is preferable to offer the discount in January or April under these conditions.\\nTo simulate this scenario, change the entry in cell H24 (increase in consumption) of  .\\nspreadsheet Chapter8,9-examples.xlsm from 0.10 (10 percent) to 1.00 (100 percent).\\nSet the entry in cell E24 to 1 to set the promotion to be on.\\nThe base case when no promotion is offered remains unchanged as shown in Figure 9-1.\\nWe now repeat the analysis for the cases in which the promotion is offered in January (off-peak) and April (peak).\\nIMPACT OF OFFERING A PROMOTION IN JANUARY For a January promotion, set the entry in cell E25 to 1(Period 1, January).\\nIf the discount is offered in January, observe that the January demand forecast is obtained as 1,600  2  0.2  (3,000  3,200)  4,440.\\nThis is much higher than the same forecast in Figure 9-2 because we have assumed consumption in the promotion month increases by 100 percent rather than the 10 percent assumed earlier.\\nThe demand forecast for a January promotion with a large increase in consumption is shown in cells J5:J10 of Figure 9-4.\\nThe optimal aggregate plan is obtained using Solver and is shown in Figure 9-4.\\nWith a discount in January the team obtains the following: Total cost over planning horizon = $456,880 Revenue over palnning horizon = $699,560 Profit over planning horizon = $242,680 Observe that a January promotion when consumption increase is large results in a higher profit than the base case (Figure 9-1).\\nIMPACT OF OFFERING A PROMOTION IN APRIL For an April promotion, set the entry in cell E25 to 4 (Period 4, April).\\nIf the discount is offered in April, observe that the April demand forecast is obtained as 3,800  2  0.2  (2,200  2,200)  8,480.\\nWith a promotion in April and a large increase in consumption, the April peak is much higher in Figure 9-5 compared to peak demand in Figure 9-4 (with a January promotion).\\nFor an April promotion with a large increase in consumption, the resulting demand forecast is as shown in cells J5:J10 of Figure 9-5.\\nThe optimal aggregate plan is obtained using Solver and is shown in Figure 9-5.\\nWith a discount in April the team obtains the following: Total cost over planning horizon = $536,200 Revenue over palnning horizon = $783,520 Profit over planning horizon = $247,320 When comparing Figures 9-5 and 9-4, observe that with an April promotion (Figure 9-5), there are no layoffs and the full workforce is maintained.\\nThe April promotion requires a much .\\nhigher level of seasonal inventory and also uses stockouts and subcontracting to a greater extent than a January promotion.\\nIt is clear that costs will go up significantly with an April promotion.\\nThe interesting observation is that revenues go up even more (because of a larger consumption increase) making overall profits higher with an April promotion compared to a January promotion.\\nAs a result, when the increase in consumption from discounting is large and forward buying is a small part of the increase in demand from discounting, the supply chain is better off offering the discount in the peak-demand month of April even though this action significantly increases supply chain costs.\\nExactly as discussed earlier, the optimal aggregate plan and profitability can also be determined for the case in which the unit price is $31 (enter 31 in cell H31) and the discounted price is $30.\\nThe results of the various instances are summarized in Table 9-2.\\nFrom the results in Table 9-2, we can draw the following conclusions regarding the impact of promotions: 1.\\nAs seen in Table 9-2, average inventory increases if a promotion is run during the peak period and decreases if the promotion is run during the off-peak period.\\nPromoting during a peak-demand month may decrease overall profitability if there is a small increase in consumption and a significant fraction of the demand increase results from a forward buy.\\nIn Table 9-2, observe that running a promotion in April decreases profitability when forward buying is 20 percent and the demand increase from increased consumption and substitution is 10 percent.\\nTable 9-2 Supply Chain Performance Under Different Scenarios  Regular Price  Percentage of  Promotion Promotion Increase in  Price  Period  Demand  Percentage of Forward Buy  Profit  $40 $40 NA  NA  $40 $39 January  10%  $40 $39 April  10%  $40 $39 January 100%  $40 $39 April  100%  $31 $31 NA  NA

.\\nTable 9-3 Summary of Impact on Promotion Timing  Factor  Impact on Timing of Promotion/Forward Buy  High forward buying High ability to steal market share High ability to increase overall market High margin Low margin High manufacturer holding costs High costs of changing capacity High retailer holding costs High promotion elasticity of consumer  Favors promotion during low-demand periods Favors promotion during peak-demand periods Favors promotion during peak-demand periods Favors promotion during peak-demand periods Favors promotion during low-demand periods Favors promotion during low-demand periods Favors promotion during low-demand periods Decreases forward buying by retailer Decreases forward buying by retailer  3.\\nAs consumption increase from discounting grows and forward buying becomes a smaller fraction of the demand increase from a promotion, it is more profitable to promote during the peak period.\\nFrom Table 9-2, for a sale price of $40, it is optimal to promote in the off-peak month of January, when forward buying is 20 percent and increased consumption is 10 percent.\\nWhen forward buying is 20 percent and increased consumption is 100 percent, however, it is optimal to promote in the peak month of April.\\nAs the product margin declines, promoting during the peak-demand period becomes less profitable.\\nIn Table 9-2, observe that for a unit price of $40, it is optimal to promote in the peak month of April when forward buying is 20 percent and increased consumption is 100 percent.\\nIn contrast, if the unit price is $31, it is optimal to promote in the off-peak month of January for the same level of forward buying and increase in consumption.\\nOther factors such as holding cost and the cost of changing capacity also affect the optimal timing of promotions.\\nThe various factors and their impacts are summarized in Table 9-3.\\nA key point from the Red Tomato supply chain examples we have considered in this chapter is that when a firm is faced with seasonal demand, it should use a combination of pricing (to manage demand) and production and inventory (to manage supply) to improve profitability.\\nThe precise use of each lever varies with the situation.\\nThis makes it crucial that enterprises in a supply chain coordinate both their forecasting and planning efforts through an S&OP process.\\nOnly then are profits maximized.\\nCoordinate planning across enterprises in the supply chain.\\nFor a supply chain to manage predictable variability successfully, the entire chain must work toward the one goal of maximizing profitability.\\nEvery member of a supply chain may agree with this in principle.\\nIn reality, however, it is difficult for an entire supply chain to agree on how to maximize profitability.\\nFirms have even had trouble getting different functions within an enterprise to plan collaboratively.\\nIncentives play a large role in this.\\nWithin a company, sales often has incentives based on revenue, whereas operations has incentives based on cost.\\nWithin a supply chain, different enterprises are judged by their own profitability, not necessarily by the overall supply chain\\'s profitability.\\nFrom the examples considered earlier, it is clear that without a focus on getting companies to work together, a supply chain will return suboptimal profits.\\nCollaboration should occur through the formation of joint teams.\\nIncentives of the members of a supply chain must be aligned.\\nsupport within an organization is needed because this coordination often requires groups to act against their traditional operating procedures.\\nAlthough this collaboration is difficult, the payoffs are significant.\\nThe concept of collaborative forecasting, planning, and replenishment is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10.\\nTake predictable variability into account when making strategic decisions.\\nPredictable variability has a tremendous impact on the operations of a company.\\nA firm must always take this impact into account when making strategic decisions.\\nHowever, predictable variability is not always taken into account when strategic plans are made, such as what type of products to offer, whether or not to build new facilities, and what sort of pricing structure a company should have.\\nAs indicated in this chapter, the level of profitability is greatly affected by predictable variability and, therefore, the success or failure of strategic decisions can be determined by it.\\nDesign S&OP to understand and manage the drivers of demand usage.\\nThe goal of the S&OP team should be to understand actual usage patterns by the consumer and to respond accordingly.\\nThe goal of S&OP should be to manage usage patterns and supply in a way that grows the supply chain surplus.\\nFor such an approach to be successful, the S&OP team must have good demand visibility across the supply chain.\\nEnsure that the S&OP process modifies plans as the reality or forecasts change.\\nIt is important that early warning alerts be built into the S&OP process.\\nA change in demand or supply circumstances may leave the reality different from plan.\\nIn such a situation, it is important for the planners to alert the supply chain regarding the old plan and provide a new plan that accounts for these changes.\\nEven if there are no short-term alerts, the output of the S&OP process should be modified as forecasts or marketing plans are adjusted.\\nManage supply to improve synchronization in a supply chain in the face of predictable variability.\\nTo manage supply with the goal of maximizing profit, companies must manage their capacity through the use of workforce flexibility, subcontracting, dual facilities, and product flexibility.\\nCompanies must also manage supply through the use of inventory by emphasizing common parts and building and holding products with predictable demand ahead of time.\\nThese methodologies, combined with aggregate planning, enable a company to manage supply effectively.\\nManage demand to improve synchronization in a supply chain in the face of predictable variability.\\nTo manage demand with the goal of maximizing profit, companies must use pricing and promotion decisions in concert with supply planning.\\nThe timing of promotions can have a tremendous impact on demand.\\nTherefore, using pricing to shape demand can help synchronize the supply chain.\\nUse sales and operations planning to maximize profitability when faced with predictable variability in a supply chain.\\nTo handle predictable variability in a profit-maximizing manner, supply chains must coordinate the management of both supply and demand.\\nThis requires coordinated planning across all stages of the supply chain to select pricing and promotion plans and aggregate plans that maximize supply chain profit.\\n Describe supply chain coordination and the bullwhip effect, and their impact on supply chain performance.\\nIdentify obstacles to coordination in a supply chain.\\nDiscuss managerial levers that help achieve coordination in a supply chain.\\nUnderstand the different forms of collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment possible in a supply chain.\\nIn this chapter, we extend the ideas from Chapter 9 and focus on improving coordination across the supply chain.\\nWe discuss how lack of coordination leads to a degradation of responsiveness and an increase in cost within a supply chain.\\nWe describe various obstacles that lead to this lack of coordination and exacerbate variability through the supply chain.\\nWe then identify appropriate managerial levers that can help overcome the obstacles and achieve coordination.\\nIn particular, we discuss how collaboration can improve supply chain performance.\\nA lack of coordination occurs either because different stages of the supply chain have objectives that conflict or because information moving between stages is delayed and distorted.\\nDifferent stages of a supply chain may have conflicting objectives if each stage has a different owner.\\nAs a result, each stage tries to maximize its own profits, resulting in actions that often diminish total supply chain profits (see Chapters 11, 13, and 15).\\nToday, supply chains consist of stages with different owners.\\nFor example, Ford Motor Company has thousands of suppliers from Goodyear to Motorola, and each of these suppliers has many suppliers in turn.\\nInformation is distorted as it moves across the supply chain because complete information is not shared between stages.\\nThis distortion is exaggerated by the fact that supply chains today produce a large variety of products.\\nFord produces different models with several options for each model.\\nThe increased variety makes it difficult for Ford 250  .\\nConsumer Demand  1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 01  Consumer Sales at

achieve coordination in spite of multiple ownership and increased product variety.\\nOne outcome of the lack of supply chain coordination is the bullwhip effect, in which fluctuations in orders increase as they move up the supply chain from retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers, as shown in Figure 10-1.\\nThe bullwhip effect distorts demand information within the supply chain, with each stage having a different estimate of what demand looks like.\\nProcter & Gamble (P&G) has observed the bullwhip effect in the supply chain for Pampers diapers.1 The company found that raw material orders from P&G to its suppliers fluctuated significantly over time.\\nFarther down the chain, when sales at retail stores were studied, the fluctuations, while present, were small.\\nIt is reasonable to assume that the consumers of diapers (babies) at the last stage of the supply chain used them at a steady rate.\\nAlthough consumption of the end product was stable, orders for raw material were highly variable, increasing costs and making it difficult to match supply and demand.\\nHP also found that the fluctuation in orders increased significantly as they moved from the resellers up the supply chain to the printer division to the integrated circuit division.2 Once again,  1 Lee, Padmanabhan, and Whang (1997).\\nwhile product demand showed some variability, orders placed with the integrated circuit division were much more variable.\\nThis made it difficult for HP to fill orders on time and increased the cost of doing so.\\nStudies of the apparel and grocery industry have shown a similar phenomenon: The fluctuation in orders increases as we move upstream in the supply chain from retail to manufacturing.\\nBarilla, an Italian manufacturer of pasta, observed that weekly orders placed by a local distribution center fluctuated by up to a factor of 70 in the course of the year, whereas weekly sales at the distribution center (representing orders placed by supermarkets) fluctuated by a factor of less than three.3 Barilla was thus facing demand that was much more variable than customer demand.\\nThis led to increased inventories, poorer product availability, and a drop in profits.\\nA similar phenomenon, over a longer time frame, has been observed in several industries that are quite prone to \"boom and bust\" cycles.\\nA good example is the production of memory chips for personal computers.\\nBetween 1985 and 1998, at least two cycles occurred during which prices of memory chips fluctuated by a factor of more than three.\\nThese large fluctuations in price were driven by either large shortages or surpluses in capacity.\\nThe shortages were exacerbated by panic buying and over-ordering that was followed by a sudden drop in demand.\\nIn the next section, we consider how lack of coordination affects supply chain performance.\\nA supply chain lacks coordination if each stage optimizes only its local objective, without considering the impact on the complete chain.\\nTotal supply chain profits are thus less than what could be achieved through coordination (see Chapters 11 and 13).\\nEach stage of the supply chain, in trying to optimize its local objective, takes actions that end up hurting the performance of the entire supply chain.\\nLack of coordination also results if information distortion occurs within the supply chain.\\nConsider the bullwhip effect P&G observed in the diaper supply chain.\\nAs a result of the bullwhip effect, orders P&G receives from its distributors are much more variable than demand for diapers at retailers.\\nWe discuss the impact of the lack of supply chain coordination on various measures of performance in the diaper supply chain.\\nManufacturing Cost The lack of coordination increases manufacturing cost in the supply chain.\\nAs a result of the bullwhip effect, P&G and its suppliers must satisfy a stream of orders that is much more variable than customer demand.\\nP&G can respond to the increased variability by either building excess capacity or holding excess inventory (see Chapter 12), both of which increase the manufacturing cost per unit produced.\\nInventory Cost The lack of coordination increases inventory cost in the supply chain.\\nTo handle the increased variability in demand, P&G has to carry a higher level of inventory than would be required if the supply chain were coordinated.\\nAs a result, inventory costs in the supply chain increase.\\nThe high levels of inventory also increase the warehousing space required and thus the warehousing cost incurred.\\nReplenishment Lead Time Lack of coordination increases replenishment lead times in the supply chain.\\nThe increased variability as a result of the bullwhip effect makes scheduling at P&G and supplier plants much more difficult than when demand is level.\\nThere are times when the available capacity and inventory cannot supply the orders coming in.\\nThis results in higher replenishment lead times.\\nTransportation Cost The lack of coordination increases transportation cost in the supply chain.\\nThe transportation requirements over time at P&G and its suppliers are correlated with the orders being filled.\\nAs a result of the bullwhip effect, transportation requirements fluctuate significantly over time.\\nThis raises transportation cost because surplus transportation capacity needs to be maintained to cover high-demand periods.\\nLabor Cost for Shipping and Receiving The lack of coordination increases labor costs associated with shipping and receiving in the supply chain.\\nLabor requirements for shipping at P&G and its suppliers fluctuate with orders.\\nA similar fluctuation occurs for the labor requirements for receiving at distributors and retailers.\\nThe various stages have the option of carrying excess labor capacity or varying labor capacity in response to the fluctuation in orders.\\nEither option increases total labor cost.\\nLevel of Product Availability Lack of coordination hurts the level of product availability and results in more stockouts in the supply chain.\\nThe large fluctuations in orders make it harder for P&G to supply all distributor and retailer orders on time.\\nThis increases the likelihood that retailers will run out of stock, resulting in lost sales for the supply chain.\\nRelationships Across the Supply Chain Lack of coordination has a negative effect on performance at every stage and thus hurts the relationships among different stages of the supply chain.\\nThere is a tendency to assign blame to other stages of the supply chain because each stage thinks it is doing the best it can.\\nThe lack of coordination thus leads to a loss of trust among different stages of the supply chain and makes any potential coordination efforts more difficult.\\nFrom the earlier discussion, it follows that lack of coordination has a significant negative impact on the supply chain\\'s performance by increasing cost and decreasing responsiveness.\\nThe impact of the lack of coordination on different performance measures is summarized in Table 10-1.\\nIn the next section, we discuss various obstacles to achieving coordination in the supply chain.\\nTable 10-1 Impact of the Lack of Coordination on Supply Chain Performance  Performance Measure  Impact of the Lack of Coordination  Manufacturing cost Inventory cost Replenishment lead time Transportation cost Shipping and receiving cost Level of product availability Profitability  Increases Increases Increases Increases Increases Decreases Decreases  Key Point The lack of coordination hurts both responsiveness and cost in a supply chain by making it more expensive to provide a given level of product availability.\\nAny factor that leads to either local optimization by different stages of the supply chain or an increase in information delay, distortion, and variability within the supply chain is an obstacle to coordination.\\nIf managers in a supply chain are able to identify the key obstacles, they can then take suitable actions to help achieve coordination.\\nWe divide the major obstacles into five categories: ?Incentive obstacles ?Information-processing obstacles ?Operational obstacles ?Pricing obstacles ?Behavioral obstacles Incentive Obstacles Incentive obstacles occur in situations when incentives offered to different stages or participants in a supply chain lead to actions that increase variability and reduce total supply chain profits.\\nLOCAL OPTIMIZATION WITHIN FUNCTIONS OR STAGES OF A SUPPLY CHAIN Incentives that focus only on the local impact of an action result in decisions that do not maximize total supply chain surplus.\\nFor example, if the compensation of a transportation manager at a firm is linked to the average transportation cost per unit, the manager is likely to take actions that lower transportation costs even if they increase inventory costs or hurt customer service.\\nIt is natural for any participant in the supply chain to take actions that optimize performance measures along which they are evaluated.\\nFor example, managers at a retailer such as Kmart make all their purchasing and inventory decisions to maximize Kmart profits, not total supply chain profits.\\nBuying decisions based on maximizing profits at a single stage of the supply chain lead to ordering policies that do not maximize supply chain profits (see Chapters 11, 13, and 15).\\nSALES FORCE INCENTIVES Improperly structured sales force incentives are a significant obstacle to coordination in a supply chain.\\nIn many firms, sales force incentives are based on the amount the sales force sells during an evaluation period of a month or quarter.\\nThe sales typically measured by a manufacturer are the quantity sold to distributors or retailers (sell-in), not the quantity sold to final customers (sell-through).\\nMeasuring performance based on sell-in is often justified on the grounds that the manufacturer\\'s sales force does not control sell-through.\\nFor example, Barilla offered its sales force incentives based on the quantity sold to distributors during a four- to six-week promotion period.\\nTo maximize their bonuses, the Barilla sales force urged distributors to buy more pasta toward the end of the evaluation period, even if distributors were not selling as much to retailers.\\nThe sales force offered discounts they controlled to spur end-of-period sales.\\nThis increased variability in the order pattern, with a jump in orders toward the end of the evaluation period followed by few orders at the beginning of the next evaluation period.\\nOrder sizes from distributors to Barilla fluctuated by a factor of up to 70 from one week to the next.\\nA sales force incentive based on sell-in thus results in order variability being larger than customer demand variability because the sales force tends to push product toward the end of the incentive period.\\nInformation-Processing Obstacles Information-processing obstacles occur when demand information is distorted as it moves between different stages of the supply chain, leading to increased variability in orders within the supply chain.\\nFORECASTING BASED ON ORDERS AND NOT CUSTOMER DEMAND When stages within a supply chain make forecasts that are based on orders they receive, any variability in customer  .\\ndemand is magnified as orders move up the supply chain to manufacturers and suppliers.\\nIn supply chains where the fundamental means of communication among different stages are the orders that are placed, information is distorted as it moves up the supply chain (see Chen, Drezner, Ryan, and Simchi-Levi [2000] for a good quantitative analysis).\\nEach stage views its primary role within the supply chain as one of filling orders placed by its downstream partner.\\nThus, each stage views its demand as the stream of orders received and produces a forecast based on this information.\\nIn such a scenario, a small change in customer demand becomes magnified as it moves up the supply chain in the form of customer orders.\\nConsider the impact of a random increase in customer demand at a retailer.\\nThe retailer may interpret part of this random increase as a growth trend.\\nThis interpretation will lead the retailer to order more than the observed increase in demand because the retailer expects growth to continue into the future and thus orders to cover for future anticipated growth.\\nThe increase in the order placed with the wholesaler is thus larger than the observed increase in demand at the retailer.\\nPart of the increase is a one-time increase.\\nThe wholesaler, however, has no way to interpret the order increase correctly.\\nThe wholesaler simply observes a jump in the order size and infers a growth trend.\\nThe growth trend inferred by the wholesaler will be larger than that inferred by the retailer (recall that the retailer increased the order size to account for future growth).\\nThe wholesaler will thus place an even larger order with the manufacturer.\\nAs we go farther up the supply chain, the order size is magnified.\\nNow assume that periods of random increase are followed by periods of random decrease in demand.\\nUsing the same forecasting logic as earlier, the retailer will now anticipate a declining trend and reduce order size.\\nThis reduction will also become magnified as we move up the supply chain.\\nLACK OF INFORMATION SHARING The lack of information sharing between stages of the supply chain magnifies the information distortion.\\nA retailer such as Wal-Mart may increase the size of a particular order because of a planned promotion.\\nIf the manufacturer is not aware of the planned promotion, it may interpret the larger order as a permanent increase in demand and place orders with suppliers accordingly.\\nThe manufacturer and suppliers thus have much inventory right after Wal-Mart finishes its promotion.\\nGiven the excess inventory, as future Wal-Mart orders return to normal, manufacturer orders will be smaller than before.\\nThe lack of information sharing between the retailer and manufacturer thus leads to a large fluctuation in manufacturer orders.\\nOperational Obstacles Operational obstacles occur when actions taken in the course of placing and filling orders lead to an increase in variability.\\nORDERING IN LARGE LOTS When a firm places orders in lot sizes that are much larger than those in which demand arises, variability of orders is magnified up the supply chain.\\nFirms may order in large lots because a significant fixed cost is associated with placing, receiving, or transporting an order (see Chapter 11).\\nLarge lots may also occur if the supplier offers quantity discounts based on lot size (see Chapter 11).\\nFigure 10-2 shows both the demand and the order stream for a firm that places an order every five weeks.\\nObserve that the order stream is far more erratic than the demand stream.\\nKey Point The fact that each stage in a supply chain forecasts demand based on the stream of orders received from the downstream stage results in a magnification of fluctuations in orders as we move up the supply chain from the retailer to the manufacturer.\\n200 Orders 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 Demand 40 20 0 1 7 13 19 25 31 37 43 49 55 61 67 73 79 85 91 97 Week .\\nBecause orders are batched and placed every five weeks, the order stream has four weeks without orders followed by a large order that equals five weeks of demand.\\nA manufacturer supplying several retailers that batch their orders faces an order stream that is much more variable than the demand the retailers experience.\\nIf the manufacturer batches its orders to suppliers, the effect is further magnified.\\nIn many instances, there are certain focal-point periods, such as the first or the last week of a month, when a majority of the orders arrive.\\nThis concentration of orders further exacerbates the impact of batching.\\nLARGE REPLENISHMENT LEAD TIMES Information distortion is magnified if replenishment lead times between stages are long.\\nConsider a situation in which a retailer has misinterpreted a random increase in demand as a growth trend.\\nIf the retailer faces a lead time of two weeks, it will incorporate the anticipated growth over two weeks when placing the order.\\nIn contrast, if the retailer faces a lead time of two months, it will incorporate into its order the anticipated growth over two months (which will be much larger).\\nThe same applies when a random decrease in demand is interpreted as a declining trend.\\nRATIONING AND SHORTAGE GAMING Rationing schemes that allocate limited production in proportion to the orders placed by retailers lead to a magnification of information distortion.\\nThis can occur when a high-demand product is in short supply.\\nIn such a situation, manufacturers come up with a variety of mechanisms to ration the scarce supply of product among various distributors or retailers.\\nOne commonly used rationing scheme is to allocate the available supply of product based on orders placed.\\nUnder this rationing scheme, if the supply available is 75 percent of the total orders received, each retailer receives 75 percent of its order.\\nThis rationing scheme results in a game in which retailers try to increase the size of their orders to increase the amount supplied to them.\\nA retailer needing 75 units orders 100 units in the hope of getting 75.\\nThe net impact of this rationing scheme is to artificially inflate orders for  .\\nIn addition, a retailer ordering based on what it expects to sell gets less and as a result loses sales, whereas a retailer that inflates its order is rewarded.\\nIf the manufacturer is using orders to forecast future demand, it will interpret the increase in orders as an increase in demand even though customer demand is unchanged.\\nThe manufacturer may respond by building enough capacity to be able to fill all orders received.\\nOnce sufficient capacity becomes available, orders return to their normal level because they were inflated in response to the rationing scheme.\\nThe manufacturer is now left with a surplus of product and capacity.\\nThese boom-and-bust cycles thus tend to alternate.\\nThis phenomenon is fairly common in the electronics industry, in which alternating periods of component shortages followed by a component surplus are often observed.\\nIn particular, memory chip manufacturing experienced a couple of such cycles in the 1990s.\\nPricing Obstacles Pricing obstacles arise when the pricing policies for a product lead to an increase in variability of orders placed.\\nLOT SIZE耑ASED QUANTITY DISCOUNTS Lot size苑ased quantity discounts increase the lot size of orders placed within the supply chain (see Chapter 11) because lower prices are offered for larger lots.\\nAs discussed earlier, the resulting large lots magnify the bullwhip effect within the supply chain.\\nPRICE FLUCTUATIONS Trade promotions and other short-term discounts offered by a manufacturer result in forward buying, by which a wholesaler or retailer purchases large lots during the discounting period to cover demand during future periods.\\nForward buying results in large orders during the promotion period followed by very small orders after that (see Chapter 11), as shown in Figure 10-3 for chicken noodle soup.\\nObserve that the shipments during the peak period are higher than the sales during the peak period because of a promotion offered.\\nThe peak shipment period is followed by a period of low 800 700 Manufacturer Shipments 600 500 400 Retailer 300 Sales 200 100 0 Weeks .\\nshipments from the manufacturer, indicating significant forward buying by distributors.\\nThe promotion thus results in a variability in manufacturer shipments that is significantly higher than the variability in retailer sales.\\nBehavioral Obstacles Behavioral obstacles are problems in learning within organizations that contribute to information distortion.\\nThese problems are often related to the way the supply chain is structured and the communications among different stages.\\nSome of the behavioral obstacles are as follows: 1.\\nEach stage of the supply chain views its actions locally and is unable to see the impact of its actions on other stages.\\nDifferent stages of the supply chain react to the current local situation rather than trying to identify the root causes.\\nBased on local analysis, different stages of the supply chain blame one another for the fluctuations, with successive stages in the supply chain becoming enemies rather than partners.\\nNo stage of the supply chain learns from its actions over time because the most significant consequences of the actions any one stage takes occur elsewhere.\\nThe result is a vicious cycle in which actions taken by a stage create the very problems that the stage blames on others.\\nA lack of trust among supply chain partners causes them to be opportunistic at the expense of overall supply chain performance.\\nThe lack of trust also results in significant duplication of effort.\\nMore important, information available at different stages either is not shared or is ignored because it is not trusted.\\nHaving identified obstacles to coordination, we now focus on actions a manager can take to help overcome the obstacles and achieve coordination in the supply chain.\\nThe following managerial actions increase total supply chain profits and moderate information distortion: ?Aligning of goals and incentives ?Improving information visibility and accuracy ?Improving operational performance ?Designing pricing strategies to stabilize orders ?Building strategic partnerships and trust Aligning of Goals and Incentives Managers can improve coordination within the supply chain by aligning goals and incentives so that every participant in supply chain activities works to maximize total supply chain profits.\\nALIGNING GOALS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN Coordination requires every stage of the supply chain to focus on the supply chain surplus or the total size of the pie rather than just its individual share.\\nIn the absence of such an approach, every supply chain leaves money on the table.\\nExamples discussed in Chapters 11 and 15 point out how total supply chain surplus drops when each stage focuses simply on maximizing its own profits.\\nA focus on the supply chain surplus is unlikely to arise until actions and incentives across the supply chain align with this objective.\\nFor example, as discussed in Chapter 15, it is important for powerful stages within the supply chain to realize that pushing all risk on to the weakest stage ultimately hurts their own profits.\\nA key to coordination is coming up with mechanisms that allow the creation of a win-win scenario in which the supply chain surplus grows along with the profits for all supply chain stages.\\nSome of these mechanisms are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 15.  .\\nALIGNING INCENTIVES ACROSS FUNCTIONS One key to coordinated decisions within a firm is to ensure that the objective any function uses to evaluate a decision is aligned with the firm\\'s overall objective.\\nAll facility, transportation, and inventory decisions should be evaluated based on their effect on profitability, not total costs, or even worse, just local costs.\\nThis helps avoid situations such as a transportation manager making decisions that lower transportation cost but increase overall supply chain costs (see Chapter 14).\\nPRICING FOR COORDINATION A manufacturer can use lot size苑ased quantity discounts to achieve coordination for commodity products if the manufacturer has large fixed costs associated with each lot (see Chapter 11 for a detailed discussion).\\nFor products for which a firm has market power, a manager can use two-part tariffs and volume discounts to help achieve coordination (see Chapter 11 for a detailed discussion).\\nGiven demand uncertainty, manufacturers can use buyback, revenue-sharing, and quantity flexibility contracts to spur retailers to provide levels of product availability that maximize total supply chain profits (see Chapter 15 for a detailed discussion).\\nBuyback contracts have been used in the publishing industry to increase total supply chain profits.\\nQuantity flexibility contracts have helped Benetton increase supply chain profits.\\nALTERING SALES FORCE INCENTIVES FROM SELL-IN TO SELL-THROUGH Any change that reduces the incentive for a salesperson to push product to the retailer reduces the bullwhip effect.\\nManagers should link incentives for the sales staff to sell-through by the retailer rather than sell-in to the retailer.\\nThis action eliminates any motivation the sales staff may have to encourage forward buying.\\nElimination of forward buying helps reduce fluctuations in the order stream.\\nIf sales force incentives are based on sales over a rolling horizon, the incentive to push product is further reduced.\\nThis helps reduce forward buying and the resulting fluctuation in orders.\\nImproving Information Visibility and Accuracy Managers can achieve coordination by improving the visibility and accuracy of information available to different stages in the supply chain.\\nSHARING POINT-OF-SALE DATA Sharing point-of-sale (POS) data across the supply chain can help reduce the bullwhip effect.\\nA primary cause for information distortion is the fact that each stage of the supply chain uses orders to forecast future demand.\\nGiven that orders received by different stages vary, forecasts at different stages also vary.\\nIn reality, the only demand that the supply chain needs to satisfy is from the final customer.\\nIf retailers share POS data with other supply chain stages, all supply chain stages can forecast future demand based on customer demand.\\nSharing of POS data helps reduce information distortion because all stages now respond to the same change in customer demand.\\nObserve that sharing aggregate POS data is sufficient to dampen information distortion.\\nIt is not necessary to share detailed POS data.\\nUse of appropriate information systems facilitates the sharing of such data (see Chapter 17).\\nWal-Mart has routinely shared its POS data with its suppliers.\\nDell shares demand data as well as current inventory positions of components with many of its suppliers via the Internet, thereby helping avoid unnecessary fluctuations in supply and orders placed.\\nP&G has convinced many retailers to share demand data.\\nP&G in turn shares the data with its suppliers, improving coordination in the supply chain.\\nIMPLEMENTING COLLABORATIVE FORECASTING AND PLANNING Once point-of-sale data are shared, different stages of the supply chain must forecast and plan jointly if complete coordination is to be achieved.\\nWithout collaborative planning, sharing of POS data does not guarantee  .\\nA retailer may have observed large demand in the month of January because it ran a promotion.\\nIf no promotion is planned in the upcoming January, the retailer\\'s forecast will differ from the manufacturer\\'s forecast even if both have past POS data.\\nThe manufacturer must be aware of the retailer\\'s promotion plans to achieve coordination.\\nThe key is to ensure that the entire supply chain is operating with a common forecast.\\nTo facilitate this type of coordination in the supply chain environment, the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards (VICS) Association has set up a Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) committee to identify best practices and design guidelines for collaborative planning and forecasting.\\nThese practices are detailed later in the chapter.\\nDESIGNING SINGLE-STAGE CONTROL OF REPLENISHMENT Designing a supply chain in which a single stage controls replenishment decisions for the entire supply chain can help diminish information distortion.\\nAs we mentioned earlier, a key cause of information distortion is that each stage of the supply chain uses orders from the previous stage as its historical demand.\\nAs a result, each stage views its role as one of replenishing orders placed by the next stage.\\nIn reality, the key replenishment is at the retailer, because that is where the final customer purchases.\\nWhen a single stage controls replenishment decisions for the entire chain, the problem of multiple forecasts is eliminated and coordination within the supply chain follows.\\nSeveral industry practices, such as continuous replenishment programs (CRP) and vendormanaged inventories (VMI) detailed later in the chapter, provide a single-point control over replenishment.\\nWal-Mart typically assigns one of its suppliers as a leader for each major product category to manage store-level replenishment.\\nThis gives suppliers visibility into sales and a single decision maker for replenishment decisions.\\nImproving Operational Performance Managers can help dampen information distortion by improving operational performance and designing appropriate product rationing schemes in case of shortages.\\nREDUCING REPLENISHMENT LEAD TIME By reducing the replenishment lead time, managers can decrease the uncertainty of demand during the lead time (see Chapter 12).\\nA reduction in lead time is especially beneficial for seasonal items because it allows for multiple orders to be placed with a significant increase in the accuracy of the forecast (see Chapter 13).\\nThus, a reduction in replenishment lead time helps dampen information distortion by reducing the underlying uncertainty of demand.\\nManagers can take a variety of actions at different stages of the supply chain to help reduce replenishment lead times.\\nOrdering electronically, either online or through electronic data interchange (EDI), can significantly cut the lead time associated with order placement and information transfer.\\nAt manufacturing plants, increased flexibility and cellular manufacturing can be used to achieve a significant reduction in lead times.\\nA dampening of information distortion further reduces lead times because of stabilized demand and, as a result, improved scheduling.\\nThis is particularly true when manufacturing produces a large variety of products.\\nAdvance ship notices (ASN) can be used to reduce the lead time as well as efforts associated with receiving.\\nCross-docking can be used to reduce the lead time associated with moving the product between stages in the supply chain.\\nWal-Mart has used many of these approaches to significantly reduce lead time within its supply chain.\\nREDUCING LOT SIZES Managers can reduce information distortion by implementing operational improvements that reduce lot sizes.\\nA reduction of lot sizes decreases the amount of fluctuation that can accumulate between any pair of stages of a supply chain, thus decreasing distortion.\\nTo reduce lot sizes, managers must take actions that help reduce the fixed costs associated with ordering, transporting, and receiving each lot (see Chapter 11).\\nSeven-Eleven Japan have been very successful at reducing replenishment lot sizes by aggregating deliveries across many products and suppliers.\\nComputer-assisted ordering (CAO) refers to the substitution through technology of the functions of a retail order clerk through the use of computers that integrate information about product sales, market factors affecting demand, inventory levels, product receipts, and desired service levels.\\nCAO and EDI help reduce the fixed costs associated with placing each order.\\nToday, the growing use of Web-based ordering by companies such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr has facilitated ordering in small lots because of reduced ordering costs for customers and reduced fulfillment costs for companies themselves.\\nIn some cases, managers can simplify ordering by eliminating the use of purchase orders.\\nIn the auto industry, some suppliers are paid based on the number of cars produced, eliminating the need for individual purchase orders.\\nThis eliminates the order-processing cost associated with each replenishment order.\\nInformation systems also facilitate the settlement of financial transactions, eliminating the cost associated with individual purchase orders.\\nThe large gap in the prices of truckload (TL) and less than truckload (LTL) shipping encourages shipment in TL quantities.\\nIn fact, with the efforts to reduce order-processing costs, transportation costs are now the major barrier to smaller lots in most supply chains.\\nManagers can reduce lot sizes without increasing transportation costs by filling a truck using smaller lots from a variety of products (see Chapter 11).\\nP&G, for example, requires all orders from retailers to be a full TL.\\nThe TL, however, may be built from any combination of products.\\nA retailer can thus order small lots of each product as long as a sufficiently large variety of products are included on each truck.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan has used this strategy with combined trucks, in which the separation is by the temperature at which the truck is maintained.\\nAll products to be shipped at a particular temperature are on the same truck.\\nThis has allowed Seven-Eleven Japan to reduce the number of trucks sent to retail outlets while keeping product variety high.\\nSome firms in the grocery industry use trucks with different compartments, each at a different temperature and carrying a variety of products, to help reduce lot sizes.\\nManagers can also reduce lot sizes by using milk runs that combine shipments for several retailers on a single truck, as discussed in Chapter 14.\\nIn many cases, third-party transporters combine shipments to competing retail outlets on a single truck.\\nThis reduces the fixed transportation cost per retailer and allows each retailer to order in smaller lots.\\nIn Japan, Toyota uses a single truck from a supplier to supply multiple assembly plants, which enables managers to reduce the lot size received by any one plant.\\nManagers can also reduce lot sizes by combining shipments from multiple suppliers on a single truck.\\nIn the United States, Toyota uses this approach to reduce the lot size it receives from any one supplier.\\nAs smaller lots are ordered and delivered, both the pressure on and the cost of receiving can grow significantly.\\nThus, managers must implement technologies that simplify the receiving process and reduce the cost associated with receiving.\\nFor example, ASNs identify shipment content, count, and time of delivery electronically and help reduce unloading time and increase cross-dock efficiency.\\nASNs can be used to update inventory records electronically, thus reducing the cost of receiving.\\nBar coding of pallets also facilitates receiving and delivery.\\nThe use of radio frequency identification (RFID) can further simplify receiving.\\nEach of these technologies works to simplify the task of shipping, transporting, and receiving complex orders with small lots of many products.\\nThis facilitates the reduction of lot size.\\nAnother simple way to minimize the impact of batching is to encourage different customers to order in such a way that demand is evenly distributed over time.\\nFrequently, customers that order once a week tend to do so on either a Monday or Friday.\\nCustomers that order once a month tend to do so either at the beginning or the end of the month.\\nIn such situations, it is better to evenly distribute customers ordering once a week across all days of the week, and customers ordering once a month across all days of the month.\\nIn fact, regular ordering days may be scheduled in advance for each customer.\\nThis generally does not affect retailers, but it does level out the order stream arriving at the manufacturer, thus reducing information distortion.\\nRATIONING BASED ON PAST SALES AND SHARING INFORMATION TO LIMIT GAMING To diminish information distortion, managers can design rationing schemes that discourage retailers from artificially inflating their orders in the case of a shortage.\\nOne approach, referred to as turn-and-earn, is to allocate the available supply based on past retailer sales rather than current retailer orders.\\nTying allocation to past sales removes any incentive a retailer may have to inflate orders.\\nIn fact, during low-demand periods, the turn-and-earn approach pushes retailers to try to sell more to increase the allocation they receive during periods of shortage.\\nSeveral firms, including General Motors, have historically used the turn-and-earn mechanism to ration available product in case of a shortage.\\nOthers, such as HP, have historically allocated based on retailer orders but are now switching to using past sales.\\nOther firms have tried to share information across the supply chain to minimize shortage situations.\\nFirms such as Sport Obermeyer offer incentives to their large customers to preorder at least a part of their annual order.\\nThis information allows Sport Obermeyer to improve the accuracy of its own forecast and allocate production capacity accordingly.\\nOnce capacity has been allocated appropriately across different products, it is less likely that shortage situations will arise, thus dampening the inflation of orders.\\nThe availability of flexible capacity can also help in this regard, because flexible capacity can easily be shifted from a product whose demand is lower than expected to one whose demand is higher than expected.\\nDesigning Pricing Strategies to Stabilize Orders Managers can reduce information distortion by devising pricing strategies that encourage retailers to order in smaller lots and reduce forward buying.\\nMOVING FROM LOT SIZE耑ASED TO VOLUME-BASED QUANTITY DISCOUNTS As a result of lot size苑ased quantity discounts, retailers increase their lot size to take full advantage of the discount.\\nOffering volume-based quantity discounts eliminates the incentive to increase the size of a single lot because volume-based discounts consider the total purchases during a specified period (say, a year) rather than purchases in a single lot (see Chapter 11).\\nVolumebased quantity discounts result in smaller lot sizes, thus reducing order variability in the supply chain.\\nVolume-based discounts with a fixed end date at which discounts will be evaluated may lead to large lots close to the end date.\\nOffering the discounts over a rolling time horizon helps dampen this effect.\\nHP is experimenting with a move away from lot size苑ased discounts to volume-based discounts.\\nSTABILIZING PRICING Managers can dampen the bullwhip effect by eliminating promotions and charging an everyday low price (EDLP).\\nThe elimination of promotions removes forward buying by retailers and results in orders that match customer demand.\\nP&G, Campbell Soup, and several other manufacturers have implemented EDLP to dampen the bullwhip effect.\\nManagers can place limits on the quantity that may be purchased during a promotion to decrease forward buying.\\nThis limit should be retailer specific and linked to historical sales by the retailer.\\nAnother approach is to tie the promotion dollars paid to the retailer to the amount of sell-through rather than the amount purchased by the retailer.\\nAs a result, retailers obtain no benefit from forward buying and purchase more only if they can sell more.\\nPromotions based on sell-through significantly reduce information distortion.\\nThe presence of specific information systems facilitates the tying of promotions directly to customer sales.\\nBuilding Strategic Partnerships and Trust Managers find it easier to use the levers discussed earlier to achieve coordination if trust and strategic partnerships are built within the supply chain.\\nSharing of accurate information that is trusted by every stage results in a better matching of supply and demand throughout the  .\\nsupply chain and a lower cost.\\nA better relationship also tends to lower the transaction cost between supply chain stages.\\nFor example, a supplier can eliminate its forecasting effort if it trusts orders and forecast information received from the retailer.\\nSimilarly, the retailer can lessen the receiving effort by decreasing counting and inspections if it trusts the supplier\\'s quality and delivery.\\nIn general, stages in a supply chain can eliminate duplicated effort on the basis of improved trust and a better relationship.\\nThis lowering of transaction cost along with accurate shared information helps improve coordination.\\nWal-Mart and P&G have been trying to build a strategic partnership that will better coordinate their actions and be mutually beneficial.\\nResearch by Kumar (1996) showed that the more retailers trusted their suppliers, the less likely they were to develop alternate sources while significantly increasing sales of their products.\\nIn general, a high level of trust allows a supply chain to become more responsive at lower cost.\\nActions such as information sharing, changing of incentives, operational improvements, and stabilization of pricing typically help improve the level of trust.\\nGrowing the level of cooperation and trust within a supply chain requires a clear identification of roles and decision rights for all parties, effective contracts, and good conflict resolution mechanisms.\\nInformation distortion can be dampened by practices that assign replenishment responsibility across the supply chain to a single entity.\\nA single point of replenishment decisions ensures visibility and a common forecast that drives orders across the supply chain.\\nTwo common industry practices that assign a single point of responsibility are continuous replenishment programs and vendor-managed inventories.\\nIn continuous replenishment programs (CRP), the wholesaler or manufacturer replenishes a retailer regularly based on POS data.\\nCRP may be supplier, distributor, or third-party managed.\\nIn most instances, CRP systems are driven by actual withdrawals of inventory from retailer warehouses rather than POS data at the retailer level.\\nTying CRP systems to warehouse withdrawals is easier to implement, and retailers are often more comfortable sharing data at this level.\\nIT systems that are linked across the supply chain provide a good information infrastructure on which a continuous replenishment program may be based.\\nIn CRP, inventory at the retailer is owned by the retailer.\\nWith vendor-managed inventory (VMI), the manufacturer or supplier is responsible for all decisions regarding product inventories at the retailer.\\nAs a result, the control of the replenishment decision moves to the manufacturer instead of the retailer.\\nIn many instances of VMI, the inventory is owned by the supplier until it is sold by the retailer.\\nVMI requires the retailer to share demand information with the manufacturer to allow it to make inventory replenishment decisions.\\nVMI can allow a manufacturer to increase its profits as well as profits for the entire supply chain if both retailer and manufacturer margins are considered when making inventory decisions.\\nVMI also helps by conveying customer demand data to the manufacturer, which can then plan production accordingly.\\nThis helps improve manufacturer forecasts and better match manufacturer production with customer demand.\\nVMI has been implemented with significant success by, among others, Kmart (with about 50 suppliers) and Fred Meyer.\\nKmart saw inventory turns on seasonal items increase from 3 to between 9 and 11, and for nonseasonal items from 12 to 15 to 17 to 20.\\nFred Meyer saw inventories drop by 30 to 40 percent while fill rates increased to 98 percent.\\nOther firms with successful implementations include Campbell Soup, Frito-Lay, and Procter & Gamble.\\nOne drawback of VMI arises because retailers often sell products from competing manufacturers that are substitutes in the customer\\'s mind.\\nFor example, a customer may substitute detergent manufactured by Procter & Gamble with detergent manufactured by Lever Brothers.\\nIf the retailer has a VMI agreement with both manufacturers, each manufacturer  .\\nwill ignore the impact of substitution when making their inventory decisions.\\nAs a result, inventories at the retailer will be higher than optimal.\\nIn such a setting, the retailer may be better positioned to decide on the replenishment policy.\\nAnother possibility is for the retailer to define a category leader from among the suppliers and have the category leader manage replenishment decisions for all suppliers in the category.\\nWal-Mart follows such a practice and assigns a category leader for most of its products.\\nWal-Mart sets the targeted level of product availability across all products and the category leader designs replenishment policies that achieve these levels.\\nThis ensures that the category leader is not favoring any one supplier\\'s product over another.\\nFor example, HP was Wal-Mart\\'s category leader for printers and managed all printer replenishment.\\nThe Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards (VICS) Association has defined CPFR as \"a business practice that combines the intelligence of multiple partners in the planning and fulfillment of customer demand.\"\\nAccording to VICS, since 1998, \"over 300 companies have implemented the process.\"\\nIn this section, we describe CPFR and some successful implementations.\\nIt is important to understand that successful CPFR can be built only on a foundation in which the two parties have synchronized their data and established standards for exchanging information.\\nMuch of the material in this section is an adaptation of material from the VICS Web site, www.vics.org/committees/cpfr.\\nSellers and buyers in a supply chain may collaborate along any or all of the following four supply chain activities: 1.\\nStrategy and planning.\\nThe partners determine the scope of the collaboration and assign roles, responsibilities, and clear checkpoints.\\nIn a joint business plan, they then identify significant events such as promotions, new product introductions, store openings/closings, and changes in inventory policy that affect demand and supply.\\nDemand and supply management.\\nA collaborative sales forecast projects the partners\\' best estimate of consumer demand at the point of sale.\\nThis is then converted to a collaborative order plan that determines future orders and delivery requirements based on sales forecasts, inventory positions, and replenishment lead times.\\nAs forecasts become firm, they are converted to actual orders.\\nThe fulfillment of these orders then involves production, shipping, receiving, and stocking of products.\\nThe key analysis tasks focus on identifying exceptions and evaluating metrics that are used to assess performance or identify trends.\\nA fundamental aspect of successful collaboration is the identification and resolution of exceptions.\\nExceptions refer to a gap between forecasts made by the two sides or some other performance metric that is falling or is likely to fall outside acceptable bounds.\\nThese metrics may include inventories that exceed targets or product availability that falls below targets.\\nFor successful CPFR, it is important to have a process in place that allows the two parties to resolve exceptions.\\nDetailed processes for identifying and resolving exceptions are discussed in the VICS CPFR Voluntary Guidelines V 2.0 (2002).\\nOne successful CPFR implementation has involved Henkel, a German detergent manufacturer, and Eroski, a Spanish food retailer.\\nPrior to CPFR, Eroski saw frequent stockouts of Henkel products, especially during promotions.\\nAt the inception of CPFR in December 1999, 70 percent of the sales forecasts had an average error of more than 50 percent and only 5 percent of the forecasts had errors less than 20 percent.\\nWithin four months of the CPFR implementation, however, 70 percent of the sales forecasts had errors less than 20 percent and only 5 percent had errors of more than 50 percent.\\nCPFR resulted in a customer service level of 98 percent and an  .\\naverage inventory of only five days.\\nThis was accomplished despite 15 to 20 products being promoted every month.\\nVICS has identified the four scenarios in Table 10-2 as the most common areas where large-scale CPFR deployments have taken place between a retailer and a manufacturer.\\nNext, we describe each of the four scenarios.\\nRetail Event Collaboration In many retail environments, such as supermarkets, promotions and other retail events have a significant impact on demand.\\nStockouts, excess inventory, and unplanned logistics costs during these events affect financial performance for both the retailer and the manufacturer.\\nIn such a setting, collaboration between retailers and suppliers to plan, forecast, and replenish promotions is effective.\\nRetail event collaboration requires the two parties to identify brands and specific SKUs that are included in the collaboration.\\nDetails of the event such as timing, duration, price point, advertising, and display tactics are shared.\\nIt is important for the retailer to update this information as changes occur.\\nEvent-specific forecasts are then created and shared.\\nThese forecasts are then converted to planned orders and deliveries.\\nAs the event unfolds, sales are monitored to identify any changes or exceptions, which are resolved through an iterative process between the two parties.\\nP&G has implemented some form of retail event collaboration with a variety of partners, including Wal-Mart.\\nDC Replenishment Collaboration DC replenishment collaboration is perhaps the most common form of collaboration observed in practice and also the simplest to implement.\\nIn this scenario the two trading partners collaborate on forecasting DC withdrawals or anticipated demand from the DC to the manufacturer.\\nThese forecasts are converted to a stream of orders from the DC to the manufacturer that are committed or locked over a specified time horizon.\\nThis information allows the manufacturer to build anticipated orders into future production plans and build the committed orders on demand.\\nThe result is a reduction in production cost at the manufacturer and a reduction of inventory and stockouts at the retailer.\\nDC replenishment collaboration is relatively easy to implement because it requires collaboration on an aggregate forecast and does not require sharing of detailed point-of-sale data.\\nTable 10-2 Four Common CPFR Scenarios  CPFR Scenario  Where Applied in Supply Chain  Retail event collaboration DC replenishment collaboration Store replenishment collaboration Collaborative assortment planning  Highly promoted channels or categories Retail DC or distributor DC Direct store delivery or retail DC-to-store delivery Apparel and seasonal goods  Industries Where Applied All industries other than those that practice EDLP Drugstores, hardware, grocery Mass merchants, club stores Department stores, specialty retail  .\\nAs a result, it is often the best scenario with which to start collaboration.\\nOver time, this form of collaboration can be extended to include all storage points in the supply chain from retail shelves to raw material warehouses.\\nAccording to Hammond (1994), Barilla implemented this form of collaboration with its distributors.\\nStore Replenishment Collaboration In store replenishment collaboration, trading partners collaborate on store-level point-of-sale forecasts.\\nThese forecasts are then converted to a series of store-level orders, with orders committed over a specified time horizon.\\nThis form of collaboration is much harder to implement than a DC-level collaboration, especially if stores are small.\\nStore replenishment collaboration is easier for large stores such as Costco and Home Depot.\\nThe benefits of store-level collaboration include greater visibility of sales for the manufacturer, improved replenishment accuracy, improved product availability, and reduced inventories.\\nThis form of collaboration is beneficial for new products and promotions.\\nManufacturers and their suppliers can use this information to improve operational execution.\\nCollaborative Assortment Planning Fashion apparel and other seasonal goods follow a seasonal pattern of demand.\\nThus, collaborative planning in these categories has a horizon of a single season and is performed at seasonal intervals.\\nGiven the seasonal nature, forecasts rely less on historical data and more on collaborative interpretation of industry trends, macroeconomic factors, and customer tastes.\\nIn this form of collaboration, the trading partners develop an assortment plan jointly.\\nThe output is a planned purchase order at the style/color/size level.\\nThe planned order is shared electronically in advance of a show, at which sample products are viewed and final merchandising decisions are made.\\nThe planned orders help the manufacturer purchase long-lead-time raw materials and plan capacity.\\nThis form of collaboration is most useful if capacity is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of product mix and raw materials have some commonality across end products.\\nOrganizational and Technology Requirements for Successful CPFR A successful CPFR implementation requires changes in the organizational structure and, to be scalable, requires the implementation of appropriate technology.\\nEffective collaboration requires manufacturers to set up cross-functional, customer-specific teams that include sales, demand planning, and logistics, at least for large customers.\\nSuch a focus has become feasible with the consolidation in retailing.\\nFor smaller customers, such teams can be focused by geography or sales channel.\\nRetailers should also attempt to organize merchandise planning, buying, and replenishment into teams around suppliers.\\nThis can be difficult given the large number of suppliers that consolidated retailers have.\\nThey can then organize the teams by categories that include multiple suppliers.\\nFor retailers that have multiple levels of inventory such as DCs and retail stores, it is important to combine the replenishment teams at the two levels.\\nWithout collaborative inventory management at the two levels, duplication of inventories is common.\\nThe proposed organizational structure is illustrated in Figure 10-4.\\nThe CPFR process is not dependent on technology but requires technology to be scalable.\\nCPFR technologies have been developed to facilitate sharing of forecasts and historical information, evaluating exception conditions, and enabling revisions.\\nThese solutions must be integrated with enterprise systems that record all supply chain transactions.\\nRisks and Hurdles for a CPFR Implementation It is important to realize that there are risks and hurdles for a successful CPFR implementation.\\nGiven the large-scale sharing of information, there is a risk of information misuse.\\nOften one or both of the CPFR partners have relationships with the partner\\'s competitors.\\nAnother risk is that  .\\nCustomer 1 Team Demand Planning Sales Customer Service/ Logistics Customer 2 Team Demand Planning Sales Customer Service/ Logistics  Category Team ?Merchandise Planning ?Buying ?Replenishment  Manufacturer Organization  Retailer Organization  .\\nif one of the partners changes its scale or technology, the other partner is forced to follow suit or lose the collaborative relationship.\\nFinally, the implementation of CPFR and the resolution of exceptions require close interactions between two entities whose cultures may be very different.\\nThe inability to foster a collaborative culture across the partner organizations can be a major hurdle for the success of CPFR.\\nOne of the biggest hurdles to success is often that partners attempt store-level collaboration, which requires a higher organizational and technology investment.\\nIt is often best to start with an event- or DC-level collaboration, which is more focused and easier to collaborate on.\\nOne of the biggest hurdles for successful CPFR, however, is that demand information shared with partners is often not used within the organization in an integrated manner.\\nIt is important to have integrated demand, supply, logistics, and corporate planning within the organization to maximize the benefits of a CPFR effort with a partner.\\nQuantify the bullwhip effect.\\nCompanies often have no idea that the bullwhip effect plays a significant role in their supply chain.\\nManagers should start by comparing the variability in the orders they receive from their customers with the variability in orders they place with their suppliers.\\nThis helps a firm quantify its own contribution to the bullwhip effect.\\nOnce its contribution is visible, it becomes easier for a firm to accept the fact that all stages in the supply chain contribute to the bullwhip effect, leading to a significant loss in profits.\\nIn the absence of this concrete information, companies try to react better to the variability rather than eliminate the variability itself.\\nThis leads companies to invest significant amounts in inventory management and scheduling systems, only to see little improvement in performance or profits.\\nEvidence of the size of the bullwhip effect is effective in getting different stages of the supply chain to focus on efforts to achieve coordination and eliminate the variability created within the supply chain.\\nGet top management commitment for coordination.\\nMore than any other aspect of supply chain management, coordination can succeed only with top management\\'s commitment.\\nCoordination requires managers at all stages of the supply chain to subordinate their local interests to the greater interest of the firm and even the supply chain.\\nCoordination often requires the resolution of trade-offs in a way that requires many functions in the supply chain to change their traditional practices.\\nThese changes often run counter to approaches that were put in place when each function focused only on its local objective.\\nSuch changes within a supply chain  .\\ncannot be implemented without strong top management commitment.\\nTop management commitment was a key factor in helping Wal-Mart and P&G set up collaborative forecasting and replenishment teams.\\nDevote resources to coordination.\\nCoordination cannot be achieved without all parties involved devoting significant managerial resources to this effort.\\nCompanies often do not devote resources to coordination because they either assume that lack of coordination is something they have to live with or they hope that coordination will occur on its own.\\nThe problem with this approach is that it leaves all managers involved with only the separate areas that they control, while no one is responsible for highlighting the impact one manager\\'s actions have on other parts of the supply chain.\\nOne of the best ways to solve coordination problems is through teams made up of members from different companies throughout the supply chain.\\nThese teams should be made responsible for coordination and given the power to implement the changes required.\\nSetting up a coordination team is fruitless unless the team has the power to act, because the team will run into conflict with functional managers who are currently maximizing local objectives.\\nCoordination teams can be effective only once a sufficient level of trust builds between members from different firms.\\nIf they are used properly, coordination teams can provide significant benefit, as has happened with the collaborative forecasting and replenishment teams set up by Wal-Mart and P&G.\\nFocus on communication with other stages.\\nGood communication with other stages of a supply chain often creates situations that highlight the value of coordination for both sides.\\nCompanies often do not communicate with other stages of the supply chain and are unwilling to share information.\\nHowever, often all companies in the supply chain are frustrated by the lack of coordination and would be happy to share information if it helped the supply chain operate in a more effective manner.\\nRegular communication among the parties involved facilitates change in such a setting.\\nFor instance, a major PC company had been ordering its microprocessors in batches of several weeks of production.\\nIt was trying to move to a build-to-order environment in which it would place microprocessor orders on a daily basis.\\nThe PC company assumed that the microprocessor supplier would be reluctant to go along with this approach.\\nHowever, once communication was opened up with the supplier, the opposite turned out to be true.\\nThe supplier also wanted to reduce lot sizes and increase the frequency of orders.\\nIt had just assumed that the PC manufacturer wanted large lots and thus never requested a change.\\nRegular communication helps different stages of the supply chain share their goals and identify common goals and mutually beneficial actions that improve coordination.\\nTry to achieve coordination in the entire supply chain network.\\nThe full benefit of coordination is achieved only when the entire supply chain network is coordinated.\\nIt is not enough for two stages in a supply chain to coordinate.\\nThe most powerful party in a supply chain should make an effort to achieve coordination in the entire network.\\nToyota has been very effective in achieving knowledge sharing and coordination in its entire network.\\nUse technology to improve connectivity in the supply chain.\\nThe Internet and a variety of software systems can be used to increase the visibility of information throughout the supply chain.\\nUntil now, most IT implementations have achieved visibility of information only within a firm.\\nVisibility across the supply chain still requires additional effort in most cases.\\nFrom the discussion in this chapter, it should be clear that the major benefits of IT systems can be realized only if the systems help increase visibility across the supply chain and facilitate coordination.\\nIf firms are to realize the full benefit of the huge investments they make in current IT systems, particularly ERP systems, it is crucial that they make the extra effort required to use these systems to facilitate collaborative forecasting and planning across the supply chain.\\nThe Internet should be used to share information and increase connectivity in the supply chain.\\nShare the benefits of coordination equitably.\\nThe greatest hurdle to coordination in the supply chain is the belief on the part of any stage that the benefits of coordination are not  .\\nbeing shared equitably.\\nManagers from the stronger party in the supply chain relationship must be sensitive to this fact and ensure that all parties perceive that the way benefits are shared is fair.\\nDescribe supply chain coordination and the bullwhip effect, and their impact on supply chain performance.\\nSupply chain coordination requires all stages to take actions that maximize total supply chain profits.\\nA lack of coordination results if different stages focus on optimizing their local objectives or if information is distorted as it moves across the supply chain.\\nThe phenomenon that fluctuation in orders increases as one moves up the supply chain from retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers is referred to as the bullwhip effect.\\nThe bullwhip effect results in an increase in all costs in the supply chain and a decrease in customer service levels.\\nThe bullwhip effect moves all parties in the supply chain away from the efficient frontier and results in a decrease of both customer satisfaction and profitability within the supply chain.\\nIdentify obstacles to coordination in a supply chain.\\nA key obstacle to coordination in the supply chain is misaligned incentives that result in different stages optimizing local objectives instead of total supply chain profits.\\nOther obstacles include lack of information sharing, operational inefficiencies leading to large replenishment lead times and large lots, sales force incentives that encourage forward buying, rationing schemes that encourage inflation of orders, promotions that encourage forward buying, and a lack of trust that makes any effort toward coordination difficult.\\nDiscuss managerial levers that help achieve coordination in a supply chain.\\nManagers can help achieve coordination in the supply chain by aligning goals and incentives across different functions and stages of the supply chain.\\nOther actions that managers can take to achieve coordination include sharing of sales information and collaborative forecasting and planning, implementation of single-point control of replenishment, improving operations to reduce lead times and lot sizes, EDLP and other strategies that limit forward buying, and the building of trust and strategic partnerships within the supply chain.\\nUnderstand the different forms of CPFR possible in a supply chain.\\nPartners may set CPFR relationships to collaborate on store events, DC replenishment, store replenishment, or assortment planning.\\nDC replenishment collaboration is often the easiest to implement because it requires aggregate-level data.\\nStore replenishment collaboration requires a higher level of investment in technology and data sharing to be successful.\\n Balance the appropriate costs to choose the optimal lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain.\\nUnderstand the impact of quantity discounts on lot size and cycle inventory.\\nDevise appropriate discounting schemes for a supply chain.\\nUnderstand the impact of trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory.\\nIdentify managerial levers that reduce lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain without increasing cost.\\nCycle inventory exists because producing or purchasing in large lots allows a stage of the supply chain to exploit economies of scale and thus lower cost.\\nThe presence of fixed costs associated with ordering and transportation, quantity discounts in product pricing, and short-term discounts or promotions encourages different stages of a supply chain to exploit economies of scale and order in large lots.\\nIn this chapter, we study how each of these factors affects the lot size and cycle inventories within a supply chain.\\nOur goal is to identify managerial levers that reduce cycle inventory in a supply chain without raising cost.\\nTime t  In the rest of this chapter, we use the following notation:  Q: Quantity in a lot or batch size D: Demand per unit time  Here, we ignore the impact of demand variability and assume that demand is stable.\\nIn Chapter 12, we introduce demand variability and its impact on safety inventory.\\nLet us consider the cycle inventory of jeans at Jean-Mart, a department store.\\nThe demand for jeans is relatively stable at D  100 pairs of jeans per day.\\nThe store manager at Jean-Mart currently purchases in lots of Q  1,000 pairs.\\nThe inventory profile of jeans at Jean-Mart is a plot depicting the level of inventory over time, as shown in Figure 11-1.\\nBecause purchases are in lots of Q  1,000 units, whereas demand is only D  100 units per day, it takes 10 days for an entire lot to be sold.\\nOver these 10 days, the inventory of jeans at Jean-Mart declines steadily from 1,000 units (when the lot arrives) to 0 (when the last pair is sold).\\nThis sequence of a lot arriving and demand depleting inventory until another lot arrives repeats itself every 10 days, as shown in the inventory profile in Figure 11-1.\\nWhen demand is steady, cycle inventory and lot size are related as follows:  Cycle inventory = lot size  Q =  22  .\\nLot sizes and cycle inventory also influence the flow time of material within the supply chain.\\nRecall from Little\\'s law (Equation 3.1) that  average inventory Average flow time = average flow rate  For any supply chain, average flow rate equals demand.\\nWe thus have  cycle inventory Q  Average flow time resulting from cycle inventory =  =  demand  2D  For lot sizes of 1,000 pairs of jeans and daily demand of 100 pairs of jeans, we obtain  Q 1,000  Average flow time resulting from cycle inventory =  =  = 5 days  2D 200  .\\nCycle inventory at the Jean-Mart store thus adds five days to the average amount of time that jeans spend in the supply chain.\\nThe larger the cycle inventory, the longer is the lag time between when a product is produced and when it is sold.\\nA lower level of cycle inventory is always desirable, because long time lags leave a firm vulnerable to demand changes in the marketplace.\\nA lower cycle inventory also decreases a firm\\'s working capital requirement.\\nToyota, for example, keeps a cycle inventory of only a few hours of production between the factory and most suppliers.\\nAs a result, Toyota is never left with unneeded parts, and its working capital requirements are less than those of its competitors.\\nToyota also allocates very little space in the factory to inventory.\\nBefore we suggest actions that a manager can take to reduce cycle inventory, it is important to understand why stages of a supply chain produce or purchase in large lots and how lot size reduction affects supply chain performance.\\nCycle inventory is held to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce cost within a supply chain.\\nTo understand how the supply chain achieves these economies of scale, we first identify supply chain costs that are influenced by lot size.\\nThe average price paid per unit purchased is a key cost in the lot-sizing decision.\\nA buyer may increase the lot size if this action results in a reduction in the price paid per unit purchased.\\nFor example, if the jeans manufacturer charges $20 per pair for orders under 500 pairs of jeans and $18 per pair for larger orders, the store manager at Jean-Mart gets the lower price by ordering in lots of at least 500 pairs of jeans.\\nThe price paid per unit is referred to as the material cost and is denoted by C. It is measured in $/unit.\\nIn many practical situations, material cost displays economies of scale and increasing lot size decreases material cost.\\nThe fixed ordering cost includes all costs that do not vary with the size of the order but are incurred each time an order is placed.\\nThere may be a fixed administrative cost to place an order, a trucking cost to transport the order, and a labor cost to receive the order.\\nJean-Mart incurs a cost of $400 for the truck regardless of the number of pairs of jeans shipped.\\nIf the truck can hold up to 2,000 pairs of jeans, a lot size of 100 pairs results in a transportation cost of $4/pair, whereas a lot size of 1,000 pairs results in a transportation cost of $0.40/pair.\\nGiven the fixed transportation cost per batch, the store manager can reduce transportation cost per unit by increasing the lot size.\\nThe fixed ordering cost per lot or batch is denoted by S (commonly thought of as a setup cost) and is measured in $/lot.\\nThe ordering cost also displays economies of scale, and increasing the lot size decreases the fixed ordering cost per unit purchased.\\nHolding cost is the cost of carrying one unit in inventory for a specified period of time, usually one year.\\nIt is a combination of the cost of capital, the cost of physically storing the inventory, and the cost that results from the product becoming obsolete.\\nThe holding cost is denoted by H and is measured in $/unit/year.\\nIt may also be obtained as a fraction, h, of the unit cost of the product.\\nGiven a unit cost of C, the holding cost H is given by  H = hC  .\\nThe total holding cost increases with an increase in lot size and cycle inventory.\\nTo summarize, the costs that must be considered in any lot-sizing decision are  ?Average price per unit purchased, $C/unit ?Fixed ordering cost incurred per lot, $S/lot ?Holding cost incurred per unit per year, $H/unit/year = hC  Later in the chapter, we discuss how the various costs may be estimated in practice.\\nHowever, for the purposes of this discussion, we assume they are already known.\\nThe primary role of cycle inventory is to allow different stages in a supply chain to purchase product in lot sizes that minimize the sum of the material, ordering, and holding costs.\\nIf a manager considers the holding cost alone, he or she will reduce the lot size and cycle inventory.\\nEconomies of scale in purchasing and ordering, however, motivate a manager to increase the lot size and cycle inventory.\\nA manager must make the trade-off that minimizes total cost when making lot-sizing decisions.\\nIdeally, cycle inventory decisions should be made considering the total cost across the entire supply chain.\\nIn practice, however, it is generally the case that each stage makes its cycle inventory decisions independently.\\nAs we discuss later in the chapter, this practice increases the level of cycle inventory as well as the total cost in the supply chain.\\nKey Point Cycle inventory exists in a supply chain because different stages exploit economies of scale to lower total cost.\\nThe costs considered include material cost, fixed ordering cost, and holding cost.\\nAny stage of the supply chain exploits economies of scale in its replenishment decisions in the following three typical situations: 1.\\nA fixed cost is incurred each time an order is placed or produced.\\nThe supplier offers price discounts based on the quantity purchased per lot.\\nThe supplier offers short-term price discounts or holds trade promotions.\\nIn the following sections, we review how purchasing managers can take advantage of these situations.\\nWhen setting cycle inventory levels in practice, a common hurdle is estimating the ordering and holding costs.\\nGiven the robustness of cycle inventory models, it is better to get a good approximation quickly rather than spend a lot of time trying to estimate costs exactly.\\nOur goal is to identify incremental costs that change with the lot-sizing decision.\\nWe can ignore costs that are unchanged with a change in lot size.\\nFor example, if a factory is running at 50 percent of capacity and all labor is full time and not earning overtime, it can be argued that the incremental setup cost for labor is zero.\\nReducing the lot size in this case will not have any impact on setup cost until either labor is fully utilized (and earning overtime) or machines are fully utilized (with a resulting loss in production capacity).\\nInventory Holding Cost  Holding cost is estimated as a percentage of the cost of a product and is the sum of the following major components:  ?Cost of capital: This is the dominant component of holding cost for products that do not become obsolete quickly.\\nThe appropriate approach is to evaluate the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC),1 which takes into account the required return on the firm\\'s equity and the cost of its debt.\\nThese are weighted by the amount of equity and debt financing that the firm has.\\nThe formula for the WACC is  WACC =  D  E +  E (Rf  +  b  *  MRP)  +  D  D +  E  Rb(1 -  t)  where E  amount of equity D  amount of debt Rf  risk-free rate of return (which is usually in the mid-single digits)   the firm\\'s beta  1 See Brealey and Myers (2000).\\nMRP  market risk premium (which is around the high single digits) Rb  rate at which the firm can borrow money (related to its debt rating) t  tax rate The WACC is adjusted for use in a pretax setting as follows: Pretax WACC = after-tax WACC/(1- t) The pretax WACC is appropriate for a firm that can increase its business using funds released by reducing inventories because inventory calculations are done pretax.\\nMost of these numbers can be found in a company\\'s annual report and in any equity research report on the company.\\nThe borrowing rate comes from tables listing the rates charged for bonds from firms with the same credit ratings.\\nThe risk-free rate is the return on U.S. Treasuries, and the market risk premium is the return of the market above the risk-free rate.\\nIf access to a company\\'s financial structure is not available, a good approximation can be made by using numbers from public companies in the same industry and of similar size.\\n?Obsolescence (or spoilage) cost: The obsolescence cost estimates the rate at which the value of the stored product drops because its market value or quality falls.\\nThis cost can range dramatically, from rates of many thousands percent to virtually zero, depending on the type of product.\\nPerishable products have high obsolescence rates.\\nEven nonperishables can have high obsolescence rates if they have short life cycles.\\nA product with a life cycle of six months has an effective obsolescence cost of 200 percent.\\nAt the other end of the spectrum are products such as crude oil that take a long time to become obsolete or spoil.\\nFor such products, a low obsolescence rate may be applied.\\n?Handling cost: Handling cost should include only incremental receiving and storage costs that vary with the quantity of product received.\\nQuantity-independent handling costs that vary with the number of orders should be included in the order cost.\\nThe quantity-dependent handling cost often does not change if quantity varies within a range.\\nIf the quantity is within this range (e.g., the range of inventory a crew of four people can unload per period of time), incremental handling cost added to the holding cost is zero.\\nIf the quantity handled requires more people, an incremental handling cost is added to the holding cost.\\n?Occupancy cost: The occupancy cost reflects the incremental change in space cost due to changing cycle inventory.\\nIf the firm is being charged based on the actual number of units held in storage, we have the direct occupancy cost.\\nFirms often lease or purchase a fixed amount of space.\\nAs long as a marginal change in cycle inventory does not change the space requirements, the incremental occupancy cost is zero.\\nOccupancy costs often take the form of a step function, with a sudden increase in cost when capacity is fully utilized and new space must be acquired.\\n?Miscellaneous costs: The final component of holding cost deals with a number of other relatively small costs.\\nThese costs include theft, security, damage, tax, and additional insurance charges that are incurred.\\nOnce again, it is important to estimate the incremental change in these costs on changing cycle inventory.\\nOrdering Cost The ordering cost includes all incremental costs associated with placing or receiving an extra order that are incurred regardless of the size of the order.\\nComponents of ordering cost include the following: ?Buyer time: Buyer time is the incremental time of the buyer placing the extra order.\\nThis cost should be included only if the buyer is utilized fully.\\nThe incremental cost of getting an idle buyer to place an order is zero and does not add to the ordering cost.\\nElectronic ordering can significantly reduce the buyer time to place an order.\\n?Transportation costs: A fixed transportation cost is often incurred regardless of the size of the order.\\nFor instance, if a truck is sent to deliver every order, it costs the same amount  .\\nto send a half-empty truck as it does a full truck.\\nLess-than-truckload pricing also includes a fixed component that is independent of the quantity shipped and a variable component that increases with the quantity shipped.\\nThe fixed component should be included in the ordering cost.\\n?Receiving costs: Some receiving costs are incurred regardless of the size of the order.\\nThese include any administration work such as purchase order matching and any effort associated with updating inventory records.\\nReceiving costs that are quantity dependent should not be included here.\\n?Other costs: Each situation can have costs unique to it that should be considered if they are incurred for each order regardless of the quantity of that order.\\nThe ordering cost is estimated as the sum of all its component costs.\\nIt is important that the ordering cost include only the incremental change in real cost for an additional order.\\nThe ordering cost is often a step function that is zero when the resource is not fully utilized, but takes on a large value when the resource is fully utilized.\\nAt that point the ordering cost is the cost of the additional resource required.\\nTo better understand the trade-offs discussed in this section, consider a situation that often arises in daily life--the purchase of groceries and other household products.\\nThese may be purchased at a nearby convenience store or at a Sam\\'s Club (a large warehouse club selling consumer goods), which is generally located much farther away.\\nThe fixed cost of going shopping is the time it takes to go to either location.\\nThis fixed cost is much lower for the nearby convenience store.\\nPrices, however, are higher at the local convenience store.\\nTaking the fixed cost into account, we tend to tailor our lot size decision accordingly.\\nWhen we need only a small quantity, we go to the nearby convenience store because the benefit of a low fixed cost outweighs the cost of the convenience store\\'s higher prices.\\nWhen we are buying a large quantity, however, we go to Sam\\'s Club, where the lower prices over the larger quantity purchased more than make up for the increase in fixed cost.\\nIn this section, we focus on the situation in which a fixed cost associated with placing, receiving, and transporting an order is incurred each time the order is placed.\\nA purchasing manager wants to minimize the total cost of satisfying demand and must therefore make the appropriate cost trade-offs when making the lot-sizing decision.\\nWe start by considering the lot-sizing decision for a single product.\\nLot Sizing for a Single Product (Economic Order Quantity) As Best Buy sells its current inventory of HP computers, the purchasing manager places a replenishment order for a new lot of Q computers.\\nIncluding the cost of transportation, Best Buy incurs a fixed cost of $S per order.\\nThe purchasing manager must decide on the number of computers to order from HP in a lot.\\nFor this decision, we assume the following inputs: D  Annual demand of the product S  Fixed cost incurred per order C  Cost per unit h  Holding cost per year as a fraction of product cost .\\nDemand is steady at D units per unit time.\\nNo shortages are allowed, that is, all demand must be supplied from stock.\\nReplenishment lead time is fixed (initially assumed to be zero).\\nThe purchasing manager makes the lot-sizing decision to minimize the total cost the store incurs.\\nHe or she must consider three costs when deciding on the lot size:  ?Annual material cost ?Annual ordering cost ?Annual holding cost  Because purchase price is independent of lot size, we have  Annual material cost = CD  The number of orders must suffice to meet the annual demand D. Given a lot size of Q, we  thus have  Number of orders per year = D Q  .\\nBecause an order cost of S is incurred for each order placed, we infer that  Annual ordering cost = a D bS Q  .\\nGiven a lot size of Q, we have an average inventory of Q/2.\\nThe annual holding cost is thus the cost of holding Q/2 units in inventory for one year and is given as QQ Annual holding cost = a bH = a bhC 22  The total annual cost, TC, is the sum of all three costs and is given as  Total annual cost, TC  =  CD  +  aDbS  +  Q a bhC  Q2  Figure 11-2 shows the variation in different costs as the lot size is changed.\\nObserve that the annual holding cost increases with an increase in lot size.\\nIn contrast, the annual ordering cost declines with an increase in lot size.\\nThe material cost is independent of lot size because we have assumed the price to be fixed.\\nThe total annual cost thus first declines and then increases with an increase in lot size.\\nFrom the perspective of the manager at Best Buy, the optimal lot size is one that minimizes the total cost to Best Buy.\\nIt is obtained by taking the first derivative of the total cost with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0 (see Appendix 11A at the end of this chapter).\\nThe optimal lot size  Cost Total Cost  Holding Cost Ordering Cost Material Cost  Lot Size .\\nis referred to as the economic order quantity (EOQ).\\nIt is denoted by Q* and is given by the following equation:  Optimal lot size,  Q*  =  2DS C hC  .\\nNote that for this formula, it is important to use the same time units for the holding cost rate h and the demand D. With each lot or batch of size Q*, the cycle inventory in the system is given by Q*/2.\\nThe flow time spent by each unit in the system is given by Q*/(2D).\\nAs the optimal lot size increases, so does the cycle inventory and the flow time.\\nThe optimal ordering frequency is given by n*, where  n* =  D Q*  =  DhC C 2S  .\\nIn Example 11-1, we illustrate the EOQ formula and the procedure to make lot-sizing decisions.\\nEXAMPLE 11-1 Economic Order Quantity  Demand for the Deskpro computer at Best Buy is 1,000 units per month.\\nBest Buy incurs a fixed order placement, transportation, and receiving cost of $4,000 each time an order is placed.\\nEach computer costs Best Buy $500 and the retailer has a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nEvaluate the number of computers that the store manager should order in each replenishment lot.\\nAnalysis: In this case, the store manager has the following inputs: Annual demand, D = 1,000 * 12 = 12,000 units Order cost per lot, S  $4,000 Unit cost per computer, C  $500 Holding cost per year as a fraction of unit cost, h  0.2 .\\nOptimal order size  =  Q*  =  2 C  *  12,000 * 4,000 0.2 * 500  =  980  .\\nCycle inventory = Q* = 980 = 490 22 For a lot size of Q* = 980, the store manager evaluates  Number of orders per year =  D Q*  =  12,000 980  = 12.24  Annual ordering and holding cost =  D Q*  S  +  Q* a bhC = 97,980 2  Q*  Average flow time =  =  490  = 0.041 year = 0.49 month  2D 12,000  Each computer thus spends 0.49 month, on average, at Best Buy before it is sold because it was purchased in a batch of 980.  .\\nA few key insights can be gained from Example 11-1.\\nUsing a lot size of 1,100 (instead of 980) increases annual costs to $98,636 (from $97,980).\\nEven though the order size is more than 10 percent larger than the optimal order size Q*, total cost increases by only 0.67 percent.\\nThis issue can be relevant in practice.\\nBest Buy may find that the economic order quantity for CDs is 6.5 cases.\\nThe manufacturer may be reluctant to ship half a case and may want to charge extra for this service.\\nOur discussion illustrates that Best Buy is perhaps better off with lot sizes of six or seven cases, because this change has a small impact on its inventory-related costs but can save on any fee that the manufacturer charges for shipping half a case.\\nKey Point Total ordering and holding costs are relatively stable around the economic order quantity.\\nA firm is often better served by ordering a convenient lot size close to the economic order quantity rather than the precise EOQ.\\nIf demand at Best Buy increases to 4,000 computers a month (demand has increased by a factor of 4), the EOQ formula shows that the optimal lot size doubles and the number of orders placed per year also doubles.\\nIn contrast, average flow time decreases by a factor of 2.\\nIn other words, as demand increases, cycle inventory measured in terms of days (or months) of demand should reduce if the lot-sizing decision is made optimally.\\nThis observation can be stated as the following Key Point: Key Point If demand increases by a factor of k, the optimal lot size increases by a factor of 1k.\\nThe number of orders placed per year should also increase by a factor of 1k.\\nFlow time attributed to cycle inventory should decrease by a factor of 1k.\\nLet us return to the situation in which monthly demand for the Deskpro model is 1,000 computers.\\nNow assume that the manager would like to reduce the lot size to Q  200 units to reduce flow time.\\nIf this lot size is decreased without any other change, we have  Annual inventory-related costs  =  a  D Q  b  S  +  a  Q 2  b  hC  =  250,000  This is significantly higher than the total cost of $97,980 that Best Buy incurred when ordering in lots of 980 units as in Example 11-1.\\nThus, there are clear financial reasons why the store manager would be unwilling to reduce the lot size to 200.\\nTo make it feasible to reduce the lot size, the manager should work to reduce the fixed order cost.\\nIf the fixed cost associated with each lot is reduced to $1,000 (from the current value of $4,000), the optimal lot size reduces to 490 (from the current value of 980).\\nWe illustrate the relationship between desired lot size and order cost in Example 11-2.\\nEXAMPLE 11-2 Relationship Between Desired Lot Size and Ordering Cost The store manager at Best Buy would like to reduce the optimal lot size from 980 to 200.\\nFor this lot size reduction to be optimal, the store manager wants to evaluate how much the ordering cost per lot should be reduced.\\nAnalysis: In this case we have Desired lot size, Q*  200 Annual demand, D  1,000 ?12  12,000 units  .\\nUnit cost per computer, C  $500 Holding cost per year as a fraction of inventory value, h  0.2  .\\nS=  hC(Q*)2 2D  =  0.2 * 500 * 2002 2 * 12,000  = 166.7  Thus, the store manager at Best Buy would have to reduce the order cost per lot from $4,000 to $166.7 for a lot size of 200 to be optimal.\\nThe observation in Example 11-2 may be stated as in the following Key Point:  Key Point To reduce the optimal lot size by a factor of k, the fixed order cost S must be reduced by a factor of k2.\\nProduction Lot Sizing In the EOQ formula, we have implicitly assumed that the entire lot arrives at the same time.\\nWhile this may be a reasonable assumption for a retailer receiving a replenishment lot, it is not reasonable in a production environment in which production occurs at a specified rate, say, P. In a production environment, inventory thus builds up at a rate of P - D when production is on, and inventory is depleted at a rate of D when production is off.\\nWith D, h, C, and S as defined earlier, the EOQ formula can be modified to obtain the economic production quantity (EPQ) as follows:  QP  =  C (1  2DS - D/P)hC  The annual setup cost in this case is given by  a  D QP  b  S  The annual holding cost is given by  QP (1- D/P)a bhC 2  Observe that the economic production quantity is the EOQ multiplied by a correction factor that approaches 1 as the production rate becomes much faster than the demand.\\nFor the remainder of this chapter, we restrict our attention to the case in which the entire replenishment lot arrives at the same time, a scenario that applies in most supply chain settings.\\nAggregating Multiple Products in a Single Order As we have discussed earlier, a key to reducing lot size is the reduction of the fixed cost incurred per lot.\\nOne major source of fixed costs is transportation.\\nIn several companies, the array of products sold is divided into families or groups, with each group managed independently by a separate product manager.\\nThis results in separate orders and deliveries for each product family, thus increasing the overall cycle inventory.\\nAggregating orders and deliveries across product families is an effective mechanism to lower cycle inventories.\\nWe illustrate the idea of aggregating shipments using the following example.\\nConsider the data from Example 11-1.\\nAssume that Best Buy purchases four computer models and the demand for each of the four models is 1,000 units per month.\\nIn this case, if each  .\\nproduct manager orders separately, she would order a lot size of 980 units.\\nAcross the four models, the total cycle inventory would thus be 4 ?980  2  1960 units.\\nAnother way to achieve this result is to have a single delivery coming from multiple suppliers (allowing fixed transportation cost to be spread across multiple suppliers) or to have a single truck delivering to multiple retailers (allowing fixed transportation cost to be spread across multiple retailers).\\nFirms that import product to the United States from Asia have worked hard to aggregate their shipments across suppliers (often by building hubs in Asia that all suppliers deliver to), allowing them to maintain transportation economies of scale while getting smaller and more frequent deliveries from each supplier.\\nThe benefits of aggregation can be stated as in the following Key Point: Key Point Aggregating replenishment across products, retailers, or suppliers in a single order allows for a reduction in lot size for individual products because fixed ordering and transportation costs are now spread across multiple products, retailers, or suppliers.\\nWal-Mart and other retailers such as Seven-Eleven Japan have facilitated aggregation across multiple supply and delivery points without storing intermediate inventories through the use of cross-docking.\\nEach supplier sends full truckloads to the distribution center (DC), containing an aggregate delivery destined for multiple retail stores.\\nAt the DC, each inbound truck is unloaded, product is cross-docked, and outbound trucks are loaded.\\nEach outbound truck now contains product aggregated from several suppliers destined for one retail store.\\nWhen considering fixed costs, one cannot ignore the receiving or loading costs.\\nAs more products are included in a single order, the product variety on a truck increases.\\nThe receiving warehouse now has to update inventory records for more items per truck.\\nIn addition, the task of putting inventory into storage now becomes more expensive because each distinct item must be stocked in a separate location.\\nThus, when attempting to reduce lot sizes, it is important to focus on reducing these costs.\\nAdvanced shipping notices (ASN) are files that contain precise records of the contents of the truck that are sent electronically by the supplier to the customer.\\nThese electronic notices facilitate updating of inventory records as well as the decision regarding storage locations, helping reduce the fixed cost of receiving.\\nRFID technology is also likely to help reduce the fixed costs associated with receiving that are related to product variety.\\nThe reduced fixed cost of receiving makes it optimal to reduce the lot size ordered, thus reducing cycle inventory.\\nWe next analyze how optimal lot sizes may be determined when there are fixed costs associated with each lot as well as the variety in the lot.\\nLot Sizing with Multiple Products or Customers In general, the ordering, transportation, and receiving costs of an order grow with the variety of products or pickup points.\\nFor example, it is cheaper for Wal-Mart to receive a truck containing a single product than it is to receive a truck containing many different products, because the inventory update and restocking effort is much less for a single product.\\nA portion of the fixed cost of an order  .\\ncan be related to transportation (this depends only on the load and is independent of product variety on the truck).\\nA portion of the fixed cost is related to loading and receiving (this cost increases with variety on the truck).\\nWe now discuss how optimal lot sizes may be determined in such a setting.\\nOur objective is to arrive at lot sizes and an ordering policy that minimize the total cost.\\nWe assume the following inputs: Di: Annual demand for product i S: Order cost incurred each time an order is placed, independent of the variety of products included in the order si: Additional order cost incurred if product i is included in the order In the case of Best Buy and multiple models, the store manager may consider three approaches to the lot-sizing decision: 1.\\nEach product manager orders his or her model independently.\\nThe product managers jointly order every product in each lot.\\nProduct managers order jointly but not every order contains every product; that is, each lot contains a selected subset of the products.\\nThe first approach does not use any aggregation and results in high cost.\\nThe second approach aggregates all products in each order.\\nThe weakness of the second approach is that low-demand products are aggregated with high-demand products in every order.\\nThis complete aggregation results in high costs if the product-specific order cost for the low-demand products is large.\\nIn such a situation, it may be better to order the low-demand products less frequently than the high-demand products.\\nThis practice results in a reduction of the product-specific order cost associated with the low-demand product.\\nAs a result, the third approach is likely to yield the lowest cost.\\nHowever, it is more complex to coordinate.\\nWe consider the example of Best Buy purchasing computers and illustrate the effect of each of the three approaches on supply chain costs.\\nLOTS ARE ORDERED AND DELIVERED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH PRODUCT In this approach, each product is ordered independently of the others.\\nThis scenario is equivalent to applying the EOQ formula to each product when evaluating lot sizes, as illustrated in Example 11-3.\\nEXAMPLE 11-3 Multiple Products with Lots Ordered and Delivered Independently Best Buy sells three models of computers, the Litepro, the Medpro, and the Heavypro.\\nAnnual demands for the three products are DL  12,000 for the Litepro, DM  1,200 units for the Medpro, and DH  120 units for the Heavypro.\\nEach model costs Best Buy $500.\\nA fixed transportation cost of $4,000 is incurred each time an order is delivered.\\nFor each model ordered and delivered on the same truck, an additional fixed cost of $1,000 is incurred for receiving and storage.\\nBest Buy incurs a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nEvaluate the lot sizes that the Best Buy manager should order if lots for each product are ordered and delivered independently.\\nAlso evaluate the annual cost of such a policy.\\nAnalysis: In this example, we have the following information: Demand, DL = 12,000/year, DM = 1,200/year, DH = 120/year Common order cost, S = $4,000 Product-specific order cost, sL  $1,000, sM = $1,000, sH  $1,000 Holding cost, h  0.2 Unit cost, CL  $500, CM  $500, CH  $500  .\\nTable 11-1 Lot Sizes and Costs for Independent Ordering  Litepro  Medpro  Heavypro  Demand per year Fixed cost/order Optimal order size Cycle inventory Annual holding cost Order frequency Annual ordering cost Average flow time Annual cost  12,000 $5,000 1,095 548 $54,772 11.0/year $54,772 2.4 weeks $109,544  1,200 $5,000

rounding.\\nThe Litepro model is ordered 11 times a year, the Medpro model is ordered 3.5 times a year, and the Heavypro model is ordered 1.1 times each year.\\nThe annual ordering and holding cost Best Buy incurs if the three models are ordered independently turns out to be $155,140.\\nIndependent ordering is simple to execute but ignores the opportunity to aggregate orders.\\nThus, the product managers at Best Buy could potentially lower costs by combining orders on a single truck.\\nWe next consider the scenario in which all three products are ordered and delivered each time an order is placed.\\nLOTS ARE ORDERED AND DELIVERED JOINTLY FOR ALL THREE MODELS Here, all three models are included each time an order is placed.\\nIn this case, the combined fixed order cost per order is given by S* = S + sL + sM + sH  The next step is to identify the optimal ordering frequency.\\nLet n be the number of orders placed per year.\\nWe then have  Annual order cost = S*n  Annual holding cost = DLhCL + DMhCM + DHhCH  2n 2n  2n  The total annual cost is thus given by  Total annual cost = DLhCL + DMhCM + DHhCH + S*n 2n 2n 2n  The optimal order frequency minimizes the total annual cost and is obtained by taking the first derivative of the total cost with respect to n and setting it equal to 0.\\nThis results in the optimal order frequency n*, where  n*  =  DLhCL C  +  DMhCM 2S*  +  DHhCH  .\\nsingle order as follows:  n*  =  a  k i=  1DihCi  C 2S*  (11.8)  Truck capacity can also be included in this setting by comparing the total load for the optimal n* with truck capacity.\\nIf the optimal load exceeds truck capacity, n* is increased until the load equals truck capacity.\\nBy applying Equation 11.8 for different values of k, we can also find the optimal number of items or suppliers to be aggregated in a single delivery.\\nIn Example 11-4, we consider the case in which the product managers at Best Buy order all three models each time they place an order.\\nEXAMPLE 11-4 Products Ordered and Delivered Jointly  Consider the Best Buy data in Example 11-3.\\nThe three product managers have decided to aggregate and order all three models each time they place an order.\\nEvaluate the optimal lot size for each model.\\nAnalysis: Because all three models are included in each order, the combined order cost is .\\n12,000 * 100 + 1,200 * 100 + 120 * 100  n* = C  2 * 7,000  = 9.75  Thus, if each model is to be included in every order and delivery, the product managers at Best Buy should place 9.75 orders each year.\\nIn this case, the ordering policies and costs are as shown in Table 11-2.\\nBecause 9.75 orders are placed each year and each order costs a total of $7,000, we have  Annual order cost = 9.75 * 7,000 = $68,250  The annual ordering and holding cost, across the three sizes, of the aforementioned policy is given by  Annual ordering and holding cost = $61,512 + $6,151 + $615 + $68,250 = $136,528  Observe that the product managers at Best Buy lower the annual cost from $155,140 to $136,528 by ordering all products jointly.\\nThis represents a decrease of about 12 percent.\\nTable 11-2 Lot Sizes and Costs for Joint Ordering at Best Buy  Litepro  Medpro  Heavypro  Demand per year (D) Order frequency (n) Optimal order size (D/n) Cycle inventory Annual holding cost Average flow time  12,000 9.75/year 1,230 615 $61,512 2.67 weeks  1,200 9.75/year 123 61.5 $6,151 2.67 weeks  120 9.75/year 12.3 6.15 $615 2.67 weeks  .\\nIn Example 11-5, we consider optimal aggregation of orders or deliveries in the presence of capacity constraints.\\nEXAMPLE 11-5 Aggregation with Capacity Constraint  W.W. Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and is considering the aggregation of inbound shipments to lower costs.\\nTruckload shipping costs $500 per truck along with $100 per pickup.\\nAverage annual demand from each supplier is 10,000 units.\\nEach unit costs $50 and Grainger incurs a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nWhat is the optimal order frequency and order size if Grainger decides to aggregate four suppliers per truck?\\nWhat is the optimal order size and frequency if each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units?\\nAnalysis: In this case, W.W. Grainger has the following inputs:  Demand per product, Di  10,000 Holding cost, h  0.2 Unit cost per product, Ci  $50 Common order cost, S  $500 Supplier-specific order cost, si  $100  The combined order cost from four suppliers is given by  S* = S + S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 = $900 per order  From Equation 11.8, the optimal order frequency is  n*  =  a  4 i=  1DihCi  C 2S*  =  4 C  *  10,000 * 0.2 2 * 900  *  50  =  14.91  It is thus optimal for Grainger to order 14.91 times per year.\\nThe annual ordering cost per supplier is Annual order cost = 14.91 * 900 = $3,354 4  The quantity ordered from each supplier is Q  10,000/14.91  671 units per order.\\nThe annual holding cost per supplier is  Annual holding cost per supplier = hCiQ = 0.2 * 50 * 671 = $3,355 22  This policy, however, requires a total capacity per truck of 4 * 671 = 2,684 units.\\nGiven a truck capacity of 2,500 units, the order frequency must be increased to ensure that the order quantity from each supplier is 2,500/4 = 625.\\nThus, W.W. Grainger should increase the order frequency to 10,000/625 = 16.\\nThis action will increase the annual order cost per supplier to $3,600 and decrease the annual holding cost per supplier to $3,125.\\nThe main advantage of ordering all products jointly is that it is easy to administer and implement.\\nThe disadvantage is that it is not selective enough in combining the particular models that should be ordered together.\\nIf product-specific order costs are high and products vary significantly in terms of their sales, it is possible to lower costs by being selective about the products being aggregated in a joint order.\\nNext, we consider a policy under which the product managers do not necessarily order all models each time an order is placed but still coordinate their orders.\\nLOTS ARE ORDERED AND DELIVERED JOINTLY FOR A SELECTED SUBSET OF THE PRODUCTS We first illustrate how being selective in aggregating orders in a single order can lower costs.\\nConsider Example 11-4 in which the manager decides to aggregate all three computer models in every order.\\nThe optimal policy from Example 11-4 is to order 9.75 times a year.\\nThe disadvantage of this policy is that the Heavypro, with annual demand of only 120 units is also ordered 9.75 times.\\nGiven that a model-specific cost of $1,000 is incurred with each order, we are essentially adding 1,000/(120/9.75)  $81.25 in order cost to each Heavypro.\\nIf we were to include the Heavypro in every fourth order (instead of every order), we would save 9,750 ?\\n(3/4)  $7,312.5 in product-specific ordering cost (save 3 out of 4 product-specific orders) while incurring an additional 500 ?0.2 ?\\n((120/9.75)/2) ?3  $3,692.3 in holding cost (because the lot size of Heavypro would increase from 120/9.75 to (120 ?4)/9.75).\\nSuch a policy would thus decrease annual cost relative to complete aggregation by more than $3,600.\\nThis example points to the value of being more selective when aggregating orders.\\nWe now discuss a procedure that is more selective in combining products to be ordered jointly.\\nThe procedure we discuss here does not necessarily provide the optimal solution.\\nIt does, however, yield an ordering policy whose cost is close to optimal.\\nThe approach of the procedure is to first identify \"the most frequently\" ordered product that is included in every order.\\nThe base fixed cost S is then entirely allocated to this product.\\nFor each of the \"less frequently\" ordered products i, the ordering frequency is determined using only the product-specific ordering cost si.\\nThe frequencies are then adjusted so that each product i is included every mi orders, where mi is an integer.\\nWe now detail the procedure used.\\nWe first describe the procedure in general and then apply it to the specific example.\\nAssume that the products are indexed by i, where i varies from 1 to l (assuming a total of l products).\\nEach product i has an annual demand Di, a unit cost Ci, and a product-specific order cost si.\\nThe common order cost is S. .\\nni  =  hCiDi C2(S + si)  This is the frequency at which product i would be ordered if it were the only product being ordered (in which case a fixed cost of S  si would be incurred per order).\\nLet n be the frequency of the most frequently ordered product i*; that is, n is the maximum among all ni (n = ni* = max {ni, i = 1, ?, l}).\\nThe most frequently ordered product is i* included each time an order is placed.\\nStep 2: For all products i Z i*, evaluate the ordering frequency:  ni  =  hCiDi C 2si  ni represents the desired order frequency if product i incurs the product-specific fixed cost si only each time it is ordered.\\nStep 3: Our goal is to include each product i Z i* with the most frequently ordered product i* after an integer number of orders.\\nFor all i Z i*, evaluate the frequency of product i relative to the most frequently ordered product i* to be mi, where  mi = ln>nim  In this case, l m is the operation that rounds a fraction up to the closest integer.\\nProduct i will be included with the most frequently ordered product i* every mi orders.\\nGiven that the most frequently ordered product i* is included in every order, mi*  1.  .\\nStep 4: Having decided the ordering frequency of each product i, recalculate the ordering frequency of the most frequently ordered product i* to be n, where  n  =  a  l i  =  1hCimiDi  D2AS  +  a  l i  =  1si  /  mi  B  (11.9)  Note that n is a better ordering frequency for the most frequently ordered product i* than n because it takes into account the fact that each of the other products i is included with i* every mi orders.\\nStep 5: For each product, evaluate an order frequency of ni  n/mi and the total cost of such an ordering policy.\\nThe total annual cost is given by  TC  =  nS  +  l a nisi i=1  +  l a i=1  a  Di 2ni  b  hCi  The procedure described above results in tailored aggregation, with higher-demand products ordered more frequently and lower-demand products ordered less frequently Example 11-6 considers tailored aggregation for the Best Buy ordering decision in Example 11-3.\\nEXAMPLE 11-6 Lot Sizes Ordered and Delivered Jointly for a Selected Subset That Varies by Order Consider the Best Buy data in Example 11-3.\\nProduct managers have decided to order jointly, but to be selective about which models they include in each order.\\nEvaluate the ordering policy and costs using the procedure discussed previously.\\nAnalysis: Recall that S  $4,000, sL  $1,000, sM  $1,000, sH  $1,000.\\nApplying Step 1, we obtain  nL  =  hCLDL C21S + sL2  =  11.0, nM  =  hCMDM C21S + sM2  =  3.5, nH  =  hCHDH C21S + sH2  =  1.1  Clearly Litepro is the most frequently ordered model.\\nThus, we set n = 11.0.\\nWe now apply Step 2 to evaluate the frequency with which Medpro and Heavypro are included with Litepro in the order.\\nWe first obtain  nM  =  hCMDM C 2sM  =  7.7  and  nH  =  hCHDH C 2sH  =  2.4  Next, we apply Step 3 to evaluate  mM  =  lnm nM  =  l 11.0 m 7.7  =  2  and  mH  =  lnm nH  =  l 11.0 m 2.4  =  5  Thus, Medpro is included in every second order and Heavypro is included in every fifth order (Litepro, the most frequently ordered model, is included in every order).\\nNow that we have decided on the ordering frequency of each model, apply Step 4 (Equation 11.9) to recalculate the ordering frequency of the most frequently ordered model as  n  =  hCLmLDL + hCMmMDM + hCHmMDH A 21S + sL/mL + sM/mM + sH /mH2  =  .\\nTable 11-3 Lot Sizes and Costs

policy is $65,383.5.\\nThe annual order cost is given by nS + nLsL + nMsM + nHsH = $65,383.5 The total annual cost is thus equal to $130,767.\\nTailored aggregation results in a cost reduction of $5,761 (about 4 percent) compared to the joint ordering of all models.\\nThe cost reduction results because each model-specific fixed cost of $1,000 is not incurred with every order.\\nFrom the Best Buy examples, it follows that aggregation can provide significant cost savings and reduction in cycle inventory in the supply chain.\\nWhen product-specific order costs (si) are small relative to the fixed cost S, complete aggregation, whereby every product is included in every order, is very effective.\\nTailored aggregation provides little additional value in this setting and may not be worth the additional complexity.\\nIf Examples 11-3, 11-4, and 11-6 are repeated with si  $300, we find that tailored aggregation decreases costs by only about 1 percent relative to complete aggregation, whereas complete aggregation decreases costs by more than 25 percent relative to no aggregation.\\nAs product-specific order costs increase, however, tailored aggregation becomes more effective.\\nIn general, complete aggregation should be used when product-specific order costs are small, and tailored aggregation should be used when productspecific order costs are large.\\nWe have looked at fixed ordering costs and their impact on the inventory and costs in a supply chain.\\nWhat is most significant from this discussion is that the key to reducing lot sizes is focusing on the reduction of fixed costs associated with each lot ordered.\\nThese costs and the processes causing them must be well understood so appropriate action may be taken.\\nNext, we consider lot sizes when material cost displays economies of scale.\\nKey Point A key to reducing cycle inventory is the reduction of lot size.\\nA key to reducing lot size without increasing costs is reducing the fixed cost associated with each lot.\\nThis may be achieved by reducing the fixed cost itself or by aggregating lots across multiple products, customers, or suppliers.\\nWhen aggregating across multiple products, customers, or suppliers, simple aggregation is effective when product-specific order costs are small, and tailored aggregation is best if product-specific order costs are large.\\nWe now consider pricing schedules that encourage buyers to purchase in large lots.\\nThere are many instances in business-to-business transactions in which the pricing schedule displays economies of scale, with prices decreasing as lot size increases.\\nA discount is lot size苑ased if the pricing schedule offers discounts based on the quantity ordered in a single lot.\\nA discount is volume based if the discount is based on the total quantity purchased over a given period, regardless of the number of lots purchased over that period.\\nIn this section, we will see that lot size苑ased quantity discounts tend to increase the lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain.\\nTwo commonly used lot size苑ased discount schemes are ?All unit quantity discounts ?Marginal unit quantity discount or multi-block tariffs In order to investigate the impact of such quantity discounts on the supply chain, we must answer the following two basic questions: 1.\\nGiven a pricing schedule with quantity discounts, what is the optimal purchasing decision for a buyer seeking to maximize profits?\\nHow does this decision affect the supply chain in terms of lot sizes, cycle inventories, and flow times?\\nUnder what conditions should a supplier offer quantity discounts?\\nWhat are appropriate pricing schedules that a supplier seeking to maximize profits should offer?\\nWe start by studying the optimal response of a retailer (the buyer) when faced with either of the two lot size苑ased discount schemes offered by a manufacturer (the supplier).\\nThe retailer\\'s objective is to select lot sizes to minimize the total annual material, order, and holding costs.\\nNext, we evaluate the optimal lot size in the case of all unit quantity discounts.\\nAll Unit Quantity Discounts  In all unit quantity discounts, the pricing schedule contains specified break points q0, q1, .\\nIf an order placed is at least as large as qi but smaller than qi+1, each unit is obtained at a cost of Ci.\\nIn general, the unit cost decreases as the quantity ordered increases; that is, C0 ?C1 ???Cr.\\nFor all unit discounts, the average unit cost varies with the quantity ordered, as shown in Figure 11-3.\\nThe retailer\\'s objective is to decide on lot sizes to maximize profits or, equivalently, to minimize the sum of material, order, and holding costs.\\nThe solution procedure evaluates the optimal lot size for each price and picks the lot size that minimizes the overall cost.\\nStep 1: Evaluate the optimal lot size for each price Ci,0 ... i ... r as follows:  Qi  =  2DS C hCi  .\\nC0 C1 C2  Average Cost per Unit Purchased  0 q1 q2 q3 Quantity Purchased .\\nStep 2: We next select the order quantity Q*i for each price Ci.\\nThere are three possible cases for Qi: 1. qi ... Qi 6 qi + 1 2.\\nQi ?qi + 1 Case 3 can be ignored for Qi because it is considered for Qi+1.\\nThus, we need to consider only the first two cases.\\nIf qi ... Qi 6 qi+1, then set Q*i = Qi.\\nIf Qi 6 qi, then a lot size of Qi does not result in a discount.\\nIn this case, set Qi* = qi to qualify for the discounted price of Ci per unit.\\nStep 3: For each i, calculate the total annual cost of ordering Qi* units (this includes order cost, holding cost, and material cost) as follows:  Total annual cost, TCi =  a  D Qi*  b  S  +  Qi* 2  hCi  +  DCi  .\\nStep 4: Select order quantity Qi* with the lowest total cost TCi.\\nGoyal (1995) has shown that this procedure can be further shortened by identifying a cutoff price C* above which the optimal solution cannot occur.\\nRecall that Cr is the lowest unit cost above the final threshold quantity qr.\\nThe cutoff is obtained as follows:  C* =  1 D  a DCr  +  DS qr  +  h 2  qrCr  -  12hDSCr b  In Example 11-7, we evaluate the optimal lot size given an all unit quantity discount.\\nEXAMPLE 11-7 All Unit Quantity Discounts Drugs Online (DO) is an online retailer of prescription drugs and health supplements.\\nVitamins represent a significant percentage of its sales.\\nDemand for vitamins is 10,000 bottles per month.\\nDO incurs a fixed order placement, transportation, and receiving cost of $100 each time an order for vitamins is placed with the manufacturer.\\nDO incurs a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nThe manufacturer uses the following all unit discount pricing schedule.\\nEvaluate the number of bottles that the DO manager should order in each lot.\\nOrder Quantity 0?,999 5,000?,999 10,000 or more  Unit Price $3.00 $2.96 $2.92  Analysis: In this case, the manager has the following inputs: q0  0, q1  5,000, q2  10,000 C0  $3.00, C1  $2.96, C2  $2.92 D  120,000/year, S  $100/lot, h  0.2 .\\nQ0  =  2DS C hC0  =  6,324; Q1  =  2DS C hC1  =  6,367; Q2  =  2DS C hC2  =  6,410  In Step 2, we ignore i = 0 because Q0 = 6,324 7 q1 = 5,000.\\nFor i = 1, 2, we obtain Q1* = Q1 = 6,367; Q*2 = q2 = 10,000  .\\nTC1  =  a  D Q1*  bS  +  a  Q*1 2  b hC1  +  DC1  =  $358,969;  TC2 = $354,520  Observe that the lowest total cost is for i = 2.\\nThus, it is optimal for DO to order Q2* = 10,000 bottles per lot and obtain the discount price of $2.92 per bottle.\\nIf the manufacturer in Example 11-7 sold all bottles for $3, it would be optimal for DO to order in lots of 6,324 bottles.\\nThe quantity discount is an incentive for DO to order in larger lots of 10,000 bottles, raising both the cycle inventory and the flow time.\\nThe impact of the discount is further magnified if DO works hard to reduce its fixed ordering cost to S = $4.\\nThen, the optimal lot size in the absence of a discount is 1,265 bottles.\\nIn the presence of the all unit quantity discount, the optimal lot size is still 10,000 bottles.\\nIn this case, the presence of quantity discounts leads to an eightfold increase in average inventory as well as flow time at DO.\\nPricing schedules with all unit quantity discounts encourage retailers to order in larger lots to take advantage of price discounts.\\nThis adds to the average inventory and flow time in a supply chain.\\nThis increase in inventory raises a question about the value that all unit quantity discounts offer in a supply chain.\\nBefore we consider this question, we discuss marginal unit quantity discounts.\\nMarginal Unit Quantity Discounts  Marginal (or incremental) unit quantity discounts are also referred to as multi-block tariffs.\\nIn this case, the pricing schedule contains specified break points q0, q1, ..., qr.\\nIt is not the average cost of a unit but the marginal cost of a unit that decreases at a breakpoint (in contrast to the all unit discount scheme).\\nIf an order of size q is placed, the first q1  q0 units are priced at C0, the next q2  q1 are priced at C1, and in general qi1  qi units are priced at Ci.\\nThe marginal cost per unit varies with the quantity purchased, as shown in Figure 11-4.\\nFaced with such a pricing schedule, the retailer\\'s objective is to decide on a lot size that maximizes profits or, equivalently, minimizes material, order, and holding costs.\\nThe solution procedure discussed here evaluates the optimal lot size for each marginal price Ci (this forces a lot size between qi and qi+1) and then settles on the lot size that minimizes the overall cost.\\nA more streamlined procedure has been provided by Hu and Munson (2002).\\nFor each value of i, 0 ... i ... r, let Vi be the cost of ordering qi units.\\nDefine V0  0 and Vi for 0 ... i ... r as follows:  Vi = C0(q1 - q0) + C1(q2 - q1) + .\\nC0 C1 C2  Marginal Cost per Unit Purchased  0 q1 q2  Quantity Purchased  .\\nFor each value of i, 0 ... i ... r - 1, consider an order of size Q in the range qi to qi+1 units; that is, qi+1 ?Q ?qi.\\nThe material cost of each order of size Q is given by Vi + (Q - qi)Ci.\\nThe various costs associated with such an order are as follows:  Annual order cost  =  a  D Q  b  S  Annual holding cost = [Vi + (Q - qi) Ci] h / 2  Annual materia cost =  D Q  [Vi  +  (Q  -  qi)Ci]  The total annual cost is the sum of the three costs and is given by  Total annual cost =  a  D Q  bS  +  [Vi  +  (Q  -  qi) Ci] h / 2  +  D Q  [Vi  +  (Q  -  qi) Ci]  .\\nOptimal 1ot size for price  Ci is Qi  =  2D(S C  + Vi hCi  qiCi)  .\\nObserve that the optimal lot size is obtained using a formula very much like the EOQ .\\nIf qi ... Qi ... qi+1 then set Qi* = Qi 2.\\nIf Qi 6 qi then set Qi* = qi 3.\\nIf Qi 7 qi+1 then set Q*i = qi+1 Step 3: Calculate the total annual cost of ordering Q*i units as follows:  TCi  =  a  D Q*i  b  S  +  [Vi  +  (Qi*  -  qi) Ci] h / 2  +  D Qi*  [Vi  +  (Q*i  -  qi) Ci]  Step 4: Select order size Q*i with the lowest cost TCi.\\nIn Example 11-8, we evaluate the optimal lot size given a marginal unit quantity discount.\\nEXAMPLE 11-8 Marginal Unit Quantity Discounts Let us return to DO from Example 11-7.\\nAssume that the manufacturer uses the following marginal unit discount pricing schedule:  Order Quantity 0?,000 5,000?0,000 Over 10,000  Marginal Unit Price $3.00 $2.96 $2.92  This implies that if an order is placed for 7,000 bottles, the first 5,000 are at a unit cost of $3.00, with the remaining 2,000 at a unit cost of $2.96.\\nEvaluate the number of bottles that DO should order in each lot.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have  q0 = O, q1 = 5,000, q2 = 10,000 C0 = $3.00, C1 = $2.96, C2 = $2.92 D = 120,000/year, S = $100/lot, h = 0.2  .\\nV0 = 0; V1 = 3(5,000 - 0) = $15,000 V2 = 3(5,000 - 0) + 2.96(10,000 - 5,000) = $29,800 .\\nQ0  =  2D(S C  + V0 hC0  q0C0)  =  6,324  Q1  =  2D(S C  + V1 hC1  q1C1)  =  11,028  Q2  =  2D(S C  + V2 hC2  q2C2)  =  16,961  In Step 2, we set Q*0 = q1 = 5,000 because Q0  6,324 > q1  5,000.\\nSimilarly, we obtain Q1* = q2 = 10,000 and Q2* = Q2 = 16,961. .\\nTC0  =  a  D Q0*  b  S  +  [V0  +  (Q*0  -  q0) C0] h / 2  +  D Q0* [V0  +  (Q0*  -  q0) C0]  =  $363,900  TC1  =  a  D Q1*  b  S  +  [V1  +  (Q1*  -  q1) C1] h / 2  +  D Q1* [V1  +  (Q*1  -  q1) C1]  =  $361,780  TC2  =  a  D Q*2  b  S  +  [V2  +  (Q2*  -  q2) C2] h / 2  +  D Q*2 [V2  +  (Q2*  -  q2) C2]  =  $360,365  Observe that the lowest cost is for i  2.\\nThus, it is optimal for DO to order in lots of Q2* = 16,961 bottles.\\nThis is much larger than the optimal lot size of 6,324 when the manufacturer does not offer any discount.\\nIf the fixed cost of ordering is $4, the optimal lot size for DO is 15,755 with the discount compared to a lot size of 1,265 without the discount.\\nThis discussion demonstrates that there can be significant order sizes and thus significant cycle inventory in the absence of any formal fixed ordering costs as long as quantity discounts are offered.\\nThus, quantity discounts lead to a significant buildup of cycle inventory in a supply chain.\\nIn many supply chains, quantity discounts contribute more to cycle inventory than fixed ordering costs.\\nThis forces us once again to question the value of quantity discounts in a supply chain.\\nWhy Quantity Discounts?\\nWe have seen that the presence of lot size苑ased quantity discounts tends to increase the level of cycle inventory in the supply chain.\\nWe now develop arguments supporting the presence of lot size-based quantity discounts in a supply chain.\\nIn each case, we look for circumstances under  .\\nwhich a lot size苑ased quantity discount increases the supply chain surplus.\\nQuantity discounts can increase the supply chain surplus for the following two main reasons: 1.\\nImproved coordination to increase total supply chain profits 2.\\nExtraction of surplus through price discrimination Munson and Rosenblatt (1998) also provide other factors, such as marketing, that motivate sellers to offer quantity discounts.\\nWe now discuss each of the two situations in greater detail.\\nCOORDINATION TO INCREASE TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN PROFITS A supply chain is coordinated if the decisions the retailer and supplier make maximize total supply chain profits.\\nIn reality, each stage in a supply chain may have a separate owner and thus attempt to maximize that stage\\'s own profits.\\nFor example, each stage of a supply chain is likely to make lot-sizing decision with an objective of minimizing its own overall costs.\\nThe result of this independent decision making can be a lack of coordination in a supply chain because actions that maximize retailer profits may not maximize supply chain profits.\\nIn this section, we discuss how a manufacturer may use appropriate quantity discounts to ensure that total supply chain profits are maximized even if the retailer is acting to maximize its own profits.\\nQuantity discounts for commodity products.\\nEconomists have argued that for commodity products such as milk, a competitive market exists and costs are driven down to the products\\' marginal cost.\\nIn this case, the market sets the price and the firm\\'s objective is to lower costs in order to increase profits.\\nConsider, for example, the online retailer DO, discussed earlier.\\nIt can be argued that it sells a commodity product.\\nIn this supply chain, both the manufacturer and DO incur costs related to each order placed by the retailer.\\nThe manufacturer incurs fixed costs related to order setup and fulfillment (SM) and holding costs (hMCM) as it builds up inventory to replenish the order.\\nSimilarly, DO incurs fixed costs (SR) for each order it places and holding costs (hRCR) for the inventory it holds as it slowly sells an order.\\nEven though both parties incur costs associated with the lot-sizing decision made by DO, the retailer makes its lot-sizing decisions based solely on costs it faces.\\nThis results in lot-sizing decisions that are locally optimal but do not maximize the supply chain surplus.\\nWe illustrate this idea in Example 11-9.\\nEXAMPLE 11-9 The Impact of Locally Optimal Lot Sizes on a Supply Chain  Demand for vitamins is 10,000 bottles per month.\\nDO incurs a fixed order placement, transportation, and receiving cost of $100 each time it places an order for vitamins with the manufacturer.\\nDO incurs a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nThe manufacturer charges $3 for each bottle of vitamins purchased.\\nEvaluate the optimal lot size for DO.\\nEach time DO places an order, the manufacturer has to process, pack, and ship the order.\\nThe manufacturer has a line packing bottles at a steady rate that matches demand.\\nThe manufacturer incurs a fixed-order filling cost of $250, production cost of $2 per bottle, and a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nWhat is the annual fulfillment and holding cost incurred by the manufacturer as a result of DO\\'s ordering policy?\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have  D = 120,000/year, SR = $100/lot, hR = 0.2, CR = $3 SM = $250/lot, hM = 0.2, CM = $2 .\\nQR  =  2DSR C hRCR  =  2 C  *  120,000 * 0.2 * 3  100  =  6,324  .\\nAnnual cost for DO  =  a  D QR  b  SR  +  a  QR 2  b  hRCR  =  $3,795  If DO orders in lots sizes of QR = 6,324, the annual cost incurred by the manufacturer is obtained to be:  Annual cost for manufacturer  =  a  D QR  b  SM  +  a  QR 2  b  hMCM  =  $6,009  The annual supply chain cost (manufacturer  DO) is thus $6,009  $3,795  $9,804.\\nIn Example 11-9, DO picks the lot size of 6,324 with an objective of minimizing only its own costs.\\nFrom a supply chain perspective, the optimal lot size should account for the fact that both DO and the manufacturer incur costs associated with each replenishment lot.\\nIf we assume that the manufacturer produces at a rate that matches demand (as assumed in Example 11-9), the total supply chain cost of using a lot size Q is obtained as follows:  Annual cost for DO and manufacturer  =  a  D Q  b  SR  +  Q a 2 b hRCR  +  a  D Q  b  SM  +  Q a 2 b hMCM  The optimal lot size (Q*) for the supply chain is obtained by taking the first derivative of the total  cost with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0 as follows:  Q*  =  2D(SR + SM) ChRCR + hMCM  =  9,165  If DO orders in lots of Q* = 9,165 units, the total costs for DO and the manufacturer are  as follows:  Annual cost for DO  =  a  D Q*  b  SR  +  Q* a 2 b hRCR  =  $4,059  Annual cost for manufacturer  =  a  D Q*  b  SM  +  Q* a 2 b hMCM  =  $5,106  Observe that if DO orders a lot size of 9,165 units, the supply chain cost decreases to $9,165 (from $9,804 when DO ordered its own optimal lot size of 6,324).\\nThere is thus an opportunity for the supply chain to save $639.\\nThe challenge, however, is that ordering in lots of 9,165 bottles raises the cost for DO by $264 per year from $3,795 to $4,059 (even though it reduces overall supply chain costs).\\nThe manufacturer\\'s costs, in contrast, go down by $903 from $6,009 to $5,106 per year.\\nThus, the manufacturer must offer DO a suitable incentive for DO to raise its lot size.\\nA lot size苑ased quantity discount is an appropriate incentive in this case.\\nExample 11-10 provides details of how the manufacturer can design a suitable quantity discount that gets DO to order in lots of 9,165 units even though DO is optimizing its own profits (and not total supply chain profits).\\nEXAMPLE 11-10 Designing a Suitable Lot Size耑ased Quantity Discount Consider the data from Example 11-9.\\nDesign a suitable quantity discount that gets DO to order in lots of 9,165 units when it aims to minimize only its own total costs.\\nAnalysis: Recall that ordering in lots of 9,165 units instead of 6,324 increases annual ordering and holding costs for DO by $264.\\nThus, the manufacturer needs to offer an incentive of at least $264 per year to DO in terms of decreased material cost if DO orders in lots of 9,165 units.\\nDecreasing material  .\\ncost by $264/year from sales of 120,000 units implies that material cost must be decreased from $3/unit to $3  264/120,000  $2.9978/unit if DO orders in lots of 9,165.\\nThus, the appropriate quantity discount is for the manufacturer to charge $3 if DO orders in lots that are smaller than 9,165 units and discount the price to $2.9978 for orders of 9,165 or more.\\nObserve that offering a lot size苑ased discount in this case decreases total supply chain cost.\\nIt does, however, increase the lot size the retailer purchases and thus increases cycle inventory in the supply chain.\\nKey Point For commodity products for which price is set by the market, manufacturers with large fixed costs per lot can use lot size苑ased quantity discounts to maximize total supply chain profits.\\nLot size苑ased discounts, however, increase cycle inventory in the supply chain.\\nOur discussion on coordination for commodity products highlights the important link between the lot size苑ased quantity discount offered and the order costs incurred by the manufacturer.\\nAs the manufacturer works on lowering order or setup cost, the discount it offers to retailers should change.\\nFor a low enough setup or order cost, the manufacturer gains little from using a lot size苑ased quantity discount.\\nIn Example 11-9 discussed earlier, if the manufacturer lowers its fixed cost per order from $250 to $100, the total supply chain costs are close to the minimum without quantity discounts even if DO is trying to minimize its cost.\\nThus, if its fixed order costs are lowered to $100, it makes sense for the manufacturer to eliminate all quantity discounts.\\nIn most companies, however, marketing and sales design quantity discounts, while operations works on reducing setup or order cost.\\nAs a result, changes in pricing do not always occur in response to setup cost reduction in manufacturing.\\nIt is important that the two functions coordinate these activities.\\nQuantity discounts for products for which the firm has market power.\\nNow consider the scenario in which the manufacturer has invented a new vitamin pill, Vitaherb, which is derived from herbal ingredients and has other properties highly valued in the market.\\nFew competitors have a similar product, so it can be argued that the price at which the retailer DO sells Vitaherb influences demand.\\nAssume that the annual demand faced by DO is given by the demand curve 360,000  60,000 p, where p is the price at which DO sells Vitaherb.\\nThe manufacturer incurs a production cost of CM  $2 per bottle of Vitaherb sold.\\nThe manufacturer must decide on the price CR to charge DO, and DO in turn must decide on the price p to charge the customer.\\nThe profit at DO (ProfR) and the manufacturer (ProfM) as a result of this policy is given by  ProfR = (p - CR)(360,000 - 60,000 p); ProfM = (CR - CM)(360,000 - 60,000 p)  DO picks the price p to maximize ProfR.\\nTaking the first derivative with respect to p and setting it to 0, we obtain the following relationship between p and CR  p = 3 + CR 2  .\\nGiven that the manufacturer is aware that DO is aiming to optimize its own profits, the manufacturer is able to use the relationship between p and CR to obtains its own profits to be  ProfM = (CR - CM) a360,000 - 60,000 a3 +  CR bb 2  = (CR - 2)(180,000 - 30,000 CR)  .\\nThus, when DO and the manufacturer make their pricing decisions independently, it is optimal for the manufacturer to charge a wholesale price of CR  $4 and for DO to charge a retail price of p = $5.\\nThe total market demand in this case is 360,000 ?60,000 p  60,000 bottles.\\nDO makes a profit of ProfR = (5  4)(360,000  60,000 ?5)  $60,000 and the manufacturer makes a profit of ProfM  (4  2)(360,000  60,000 ?5)  $120,000.\\nNow consider the case in which the two stages coordinate their pricing decisions with a goal of maximizing the supply chain profit ProfSC, which is given by ProfSC = (p - CM)(360,000 - 60,000 p) The optimal retail price is obtained by setting the first derivative of ProfSC with respect to p to 0.\\nWe thus obtain the coordinated retail price to be p = 3 + CM = 3 + 2 = $4 22 If the two stages coordinate pricing and DO prices at p  $4, market demand is 360,000  60,000p  120,000 bottles.\\nThe total supply chain profit if the two stages coordinate is ProfSC = ($4 - $2) * 120,000 = $240,000.\\nAs a result of each stage settings its price independently, the supply chain thus loses $60,000 in profit.\\nThis phenomenon is referred to as double marginalization.\\nDouble marginalization leads to a loss in profit because the supply chain margin is divided between two stages, but each stage makes its pricing decision considering only its local profits.\\nKey Point The supply chain profit is lower if each stage of the supply chain makes its pricing decisions independently, with the objective of maximizing its own profit.\\nA coordinated solution results in higher profit.\\nGiven that independent pricing decision lower supply chain profits, it is important to consider pricing schemes that may help recover some of these profits even when each stage of the supply chain continues to act independently.\\nWe propose two pricing schemes that the manufacturer may use to achieve the coordinated solution and maximize supply chain profits even though DO acts in a way that maximizes its own profit.\\nTwo-part tariff: In this case, the manufacturer charges its entire profit as an up-front franchise fee ff (which could be anywhere between the noncoordinated manufacturer profit ProfM and the difference between the coordinated supply chain profit and the noncoordinated retailer profit, ProfSC ?ProfR) and then sells to the retailer at cost, that is, the manufacturer sets its wholesale price CR  CM.\\nThis pricing scheme is referred to as a two-part tariff because the manufacturer sets both the franchise fee and the wholesale price.\\nThe retail pricing decision is thus based on maximizing its profits (p  CM)(360,000  60,000p)  ff.\\nUnder the two-part tariff, the franchise fee ff is paid up front and is thus a fixed cost that does not change with the retail price p. The retailer DO is thus effectively maximizing the coordinated supply chain profits ProfSC  (p  CM)(360,000  60,000p).\\nTaking the first derivative with respect to p and setting it equal to 0, the optimal coordinated retail price p is evaluated to be p = 3 + CM 2 In the case of DO, recall that total supply chain profit when the two stages coordinate is ProfSC = $240,000 with DO charging the customer $4 per bottle of Vitaherb.\\nThe profit made by DO when the two stages do not coordinate is ProfR  $60,000.\\nOne option available to the manufacturer is to construct a two-part tariff by which DO is charged an up-front fee of ff  ProfSC ?ProfR  $180,000 and material cost of CR  CM  $2 per bottle.\\nits profit if it prices the vitamins at p  3  CM  2  3 + 2  2  $4 per bottle.\\nIt has annual sales of 360,000  60,000 p  120,000 and profits of $60,000.\\nThe manufacturer makes a profit of $180,000, which it charges up front.\\nObserve that the use of a two-part tariff has increased supply chain profits from $180,000 to $240,000 even though the retailer DO has made a locally optimal pricing decision given the two-part tariff.\\nA similar result can be obtained as long as the manufacturer sets the up-front fee ff to be any value between $120,000 and $180,000 with a wholesale price of CR  CM.\\nVolume-based quantity discount: Observe that the two-part tariff is really a volumebased quantity discount whereby the retailer DO pays a lower average unit cost as it purchases larger quantities each year (the franchise fee ff is amortized over more units).\\nThis observation can be made explicit by designing a volume-based discount scheme that gets the retailer DO to purchase and sell the quantity sold when the two stages coordinate their actions.\\nRecall that the coordinated solution results in a retail price of p  3  CM2  3  2  2  4.\\nThis retail price results in total demand of dcoord  360,000 ?60,000 ?4  120,000.\\nThe objective of the manufacturer is to design a volume-based discounting scheme that gets the retailer DO to buy (and sell) dcoord  120,000 units each year.\\nThe pricing scheme must be such that retailer gets a profit of at least $60,000, and the manufacturer gets a profit of at least $120,000 (these are the profits that DO and the manufacturer made when their actions were not coordinated).\\nSeveral such pricing schemes can be designed.\\nOne such scheme is for the manufacturer to charge a wholesale price of CR  $4 per bottle (this is the same wholesale price that is optimal when the two stages are not coordinated) for annual sales below dcoord 120,000 units, and to charge CR  $3.50 (any value between $3.00 and $3.50 will work) for sales of 120,000 or more.\\nIt is then optimal for DO to order 120,000 units in the year and price them at p  $4 per bottle to the customers (to ensure that they are all sold).\\nThe total profit earned by DO (360,000 - 60,000 * p) * (p - CR) = $60,000.\\nThe total profit earned by the manufacturer is 120,000 * (CR - $2) = $180,000 when CR  $3.50.\\nThe total supply chain profit is $240,000, which is higher than the $180,000 that the supply chain earned when actions were not coordinated.\\nIf the manufacturer charges $3.00 (instead of $3.50) for sales of 120,000 units or more, it is still optimal for DO to order 120,000 units in the year and price them at p  $4 per bottle.\\nThe only difference is that the total profit earned by DO now increases to $120,000 while that for the manufacturer now drops to $120,000.\\nThe total supply chain profits remain at $240,000.\\nThe price that the manufacturer is able to charge (between $3.00 and $3.50) for sales of 120,000 or more will depend on the relative bargaining power of the two parties.\\nAt this stage, we have seen that even in the absence of inventory-related costs, quantity discounts play a role in supply chain coordination and improved supply chain profits.\\nUnless the manufacturer has large fixed costs associated with each lot, the discount schemes that are optimal are volume based and not lot size based.\\nIt can be shown that even in the presence of large fixed costs for the manufacturer, a two-part tariff or volume-based discount, with the manufacturer passing on some of the fixed cost to the retailer, optimally coordinates the supply chain and maximizes profits given the assumption that customer demand decreases when the retailer increases price.\\nA key distinction between lot size苑ased and volume discounts is that lot-size discounts are based on the quantity purchased per lot, not the rate of purchase.\\nVolume discounts, in contrast, are based on the rate of purchase or volume purchased on average per specified time period (say, a month, quarter, or year).\\nLot size苑ased discounts tend to raise the cycle inventory in the supply Key Point For products for which the firm has market power, two-part tariffs or volume-based quantity discounts can be used to achieve coordination in the supply chain and maximize supply chain profits.\\nKey Point For products for which a firm has market power, lot size苑ased discounts are not optimal for the supply chain even in the presence of inventory costs.\\nIn such a setting, either a two-part tariff or a volume-based discount, with the supplier passing on some of its fixed cost to the retailer, is needed for the supply chain to be coordinated and maximize profits.\\nchain by encouraging retailers to increase the size of each lot.\\nVolume-based discounts, in contrast, are compatible with small lots that reduce cycle inventory.\\nLot size苑ased discounts make sense only when the manufacturer incurs high fixed cost per order.\\nIn all other instances, it is better to have volume-based discounts.\\nOne can make the point that even with volume-based discounts, retailers will tend to increase the size of the lot toward the end of the evaluation period.\\nFor example, assume that the manufacturer offers DO a 2 percent discount if the number of bottles of Vitaherb purchased over a quarter exceeds 40,000.\\nThis policy will not affect the lot sizes DO orders early during the quarter, and DO will order in small lots to match the quantity ordered with demand.\\nConsider a situation, however, in which DO has sold only 30,000 bottles with a week left before the end of the quarter.\\nTo get the quantity discount, DO may order 10,000 bottles over the last week even though it expects to sell only 3,000.\\nIn this case, cycle inventory in the supply chain goes up in spite of the fact that there is no lot size苑ased quantity discount.\\nThe situation in which orders peak toward the end of a financial horizon is referred to as the hockey stick phenomenon because demand increases dramatically toward the end of a period, similar to the way a hockey stick bends upward toward its end.\\nThis phenomenon has been observed in many industries.\\nOne possible solution is to base the volume discounts on a rolling horizon.\\nFor example, each week the manufacturer may offer DO the volume discount based on sales over the past 12 weeks.\\nSuch a rolling horizon dampens the hockey stick phenomenon by making each week the last week in some 12-week horizon.\\nThus far, we have discussed only the scenario in which the supply chain has a single retailer.\\nOne may ask whether our insights are robust and also apply if the supply chain has multiple retailers, each with different demand curves, all supplied by a single manufacturer.\\nAs one would expect, the form of the discount scheme to be offered becomes more complicated in these settings (typically, instead of having only one break point at which the volume-based discount is offered, there are multiple breakpoints).\\nThe basic form of the optimal pricing scheme, however, does not change.\\nThe optimal discount continues to be volume based, with the average price charged to the retailers decreasing as the rate of purchase (volume purchased per unit time) increases.\\nPRICE DISCRIMINATION TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLIER PROFITS Price discrimination is the practice whereby a firm charges differential prices to maximize profits.\\nAn example of price discrimination is airlines: Passengers traveling on the same plane often pay different prices for their seats.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 16, setting a fixed price for all units does not maximize profits for the manufacturer.\\nIn principle, the manufacturer can obtain the entire area under the demand curve above its marginal cost by pricing each unit differently based on customers\\' marginal evaluation at each quantity.\\nQuantity discounts are one mechanism for price discrimination because customers pay different prices based on the quantity purchased.\\nNext we discuss trade promotions and their impact on lot sizes and cycle inventory in the supply chain.\\nKey Point Price discrimination to maximize profits at the manufacturer may also be a reason to offer quantity discounts within a supply chain.\\nManufacturers use trade promotions to offer a discounted price to retailers and a time period over which the discount is effective.\\nFor example, a manufacturer of canned soup may offer a price discount of 10 percent for the shipping period December 15 to January 25.\\nFor all purchases within the specified time horizon, retailers get a 10 percent discount.\\nIn some cases, the manufacturer may require specific actions from the retailer, such as displays, advertising, promotion, and so on, to qualify for the trade promotion.\\nTrade promotions are quite common in the consumer packagedgoods industry, with manufacturers promoting different products at different times of the year.\\nThe goal of trade promotions is to influence retailers to act in a way that helps the manufacturer achieve its objectives.\\nA few of the key goals (from the manufacturer\\'s perspective) of a trade promotion are as follows:2  1.\\nInduce retailers to use price discounts, displays, or advertising to spur sales.\\nShift inventory from the manufacturer to the retailer and the customer.\\nDefend a brand against competition.\\nAlthough these may be the manufacturer\\'s objectives, it is not clear that they are always achieved as the result of a trade promotion.\\nOur goal in this section is to investigate the impact of a trade promotion on the behavior of the retailer and the performance of the entire supply chain.\\nThe key to understanding this impact is to focus on how a retailer reacts to a trade promotion that a manufacturer offers.\\nIn response to a trade promotion, the retailer has the following options:  1.\\nPass through some or all of the promotion to customers to spur sales.\\nPass through very little of the promotion to customers but purchase in greater quantity during the promotion period to exploit the temporary reduction in price.\\nThe first action lowers the price of the product for the end customer, leading to increased purchases and thus increased sales for the entire supply chain.\\nThe second action does not increase purchases by the customer but increases the amount of inventory held at the retailer.\\nAs a result, the cycle inventory and flow time within the supply chain increase.\\nA forward buy occurs when a retailer purchases in the promotional period for sales in future periods.\\nA forward buy helps reduce the retailer\\'s future cost of goods for product sold after the promotion ends.\\nAlthough a forward buy is often the retailer\\'s appropriate response to a price promotion, it usually increases demand variability with a resulting increase in inventory and flow times within the supply chain, and it can decrease supply chain profits.\\nOur objective in this section is to understand a retailer\\'s optimal response when faced with a trade promotion.\\nWe identify the factors affecting the forward buy and quantify the size of a forward buy by the retailer.\\nWe also identify factors that influence the amount of the promotion that a retailer passes on to the customer.\\nQ*  =  2DS C hC  Campbell announces that it is offering a discount of $d per can for the coming four-week period.\\nCub Foods must decide how much to order at the discounted price compared to the lot size of Q* that it normally orders.\\nLet Qd be the lot size ordered at the discounted price.\\n2 See Blattberg and Neslin (1990) for more details.\\nt  The costs the retailer must consider when making this decision are material cost, holding cost, and order cost.\\nIncreasing the lot size Qd lowers the material cost for Cub Foods because it purchases more cans (for sale now and in the future) at the discounted price.\\nIncreasing the lot size Qd increases the holding cost because inventories increase.\\nIncreasing the lot size Qd lowers the order cost for Cub Foods because some orders that would otherwise have been placed are now not necessary.\\nCub Food\\'s goal is to make the trade-off that minimizes the total cost.\\nThe inventory pattern when a lot size of Qd is followed by lot sizes of Q* is shown in Figure 11-5.\\nThe objective is to identify Qd that minimizes the total cost (material cost  ordering cost  holding cost) over the time interval during which the quantity Qd (ordered during the promotion period) is consumed.\\nThe precise analysis in this case is complex, so we present a result that holds under some restrictions.3 The first key assumption is that the discount is offered once, with no future discounts.\\nThe second key assumption is that the retailer takes no action (such as passing on part of the trade promotion) to influence customer demand.\\nThe customer demand thus remains unchanged.\\nThe third key assumption is that we analyze a period over which the demand is an integer multiple of Q*.\\nWith these assumptions, the optimal order quantity at the discounted price is given by  Qd =  dD (C - d)h  +  CQ* C-d  .\\nIn practice, retailers are often aware of the timing of the next promotion.\\nIf the demand until the next anticipated trade promotion is Q1, it is optimal for the retailer to order min{Qd, Q1} Observe that the quantity Qd ordered as a result of the promotion is larger than the regular order quantity Q*.\\nThe forward buy in this case is given by  Forward buy = Qd - Q*  Even for relatively small discounts, the order size increases by a large quantity, as illustrated in Example 11-11.\\n3 See Silver, Pyke, and Petersen (1998) for a more detailed discussion.\\nEXAMPLE 11-11 Impact of Trade Promotions on Lot Sizes  DO is a retailer that sells Vitaherb, a popular vitamin diet supplement.\\nDemand for Vitaherb is 120,000 bottles per year.\\nThe manufacturer currently charges $3 for each bottle, and DO incurs a holding cost of 20 percent.\\nDO currently orders in lots of Q* = 6,324 bottles.\\nThe manufacturer has offered a discount of $0.15 for all bottles purchased by retailers over the coming month.\\nHow many bottles of Vitaherb should DO order given the promotion?\\nAnalysis: In the absence of any promotion, DO orders in lot sizes of Q* = 6,324 bottles.\\nGiven a monthly demand of D = 10,000 bottles, DO normally orders every 0.6324 months.\\nIn the absence of the trade promotion we have the following: Cycle inventory at DO = Q*/2 = 6,324/2 = 3,162 bottles Average flow time = Q*/2D = 6,324 / (2D) = 0.3162 months  .\\nQd =  dD (C - d)h  +  CQ* C-d  =  0.15 * 120,000 (3.00 - 0.15) * 0.20  +  3 * 6,324 3.00 - 0.15  = 38,236  During the promotion, DO should place an order for a lot size of 38,236.\\nIn other words, DO places an order for 3.8236 months\\' worth of demand.\\nIn the presence of the trade promotion we have Cycle inentory at DO = Qd/ 2 = 38,236/ 2 = 19,118 bottles Average flow time = Qd/(2D) = 38,236/(20,000) = 1.9118 months  In this case, the forward buy is given by Forward buy = Qd - Q* = 38,236 - 6,324 = 31,912 bottles  As a result of this forward buy, DO will not place any order for the next 3.8236 months (without a forward buy, DO would have placed another 31,912/6,324  5.05 orders for 6,324 bottles each during this period).\\nObserve that a 5 percent discount causes the lot size to increase by more than 500 percent.\\nAs the example illustrates, forward buying as a result of trade promotions leads to a significant increase in the quantity ordered by the retailer.\\nThe large order is then followed by a period of low orders to compensate for the inventory built up at the retailer.\\nThe fluctuation in orders as a result of trade promotions is one of the major contributors to the bullwhip effect discussed in Chapter 10.\\nThe retailer can justify the forward buying during a trade promotion because it decreases its total cost.\\nIn contrast, the manufacturer can justify this action only as a competitive necessity (to counter a competitor\\'s promotion) or if it has either inadvertently built up a lot of excess inventory or the forward buy allows the manufacturer to smooth demand by shifting it from peak- to low-demand periods.\\nIn practice, manufacturers often build up inventory in anticipation of planned promotions.\\nDuring the trade promotion, this inventory shifts to the retailer, primarily as a forward buy.\\nIf the forward buy during trade promotions is a significant fraction of total sales, manufacturers end up reducing the revenues they earn from sales because most of the product is sold at a discount.\\nThe increase in inventory and the decrease in revenues often lead to a reduction in manufacturer as well as total supply chain profits as a result of trade promotions.4  4 See Blattberg and Neslin (1990) for more details.\\nKey Point Trade promotions lead to a significant increase in lot size and cycle inventory because of forward buying by the retailer.\\nThis generally results in reduced supply chain profits unless the trade promotion reduces demand fluctuations.\\nNow let us consider the extent to which the retailer may find it optimal to pass through some of the discount to the end customer to spur sales.\\nAs Example 11-12 shows, it is not optimal for the retailer to pass through the entire discount to the customer.\\nIn other words, it is optimal for the retailer to capture part of the promotion and pass through only part of it to the customer.\\nEXAMPLE 11-12 How Much of a Discount Should the Retailer Pass Through?\\nAssume that DO faces a demand curve for Vitaherb of 300,000 - 60,000 p. The normal price charged by the manufacturer to the retailer is CR  $3 per bottle.\\nIgnoring all inventory-related costs, evaluate the optimal response of DO to a discount of $0.15 per unit.\\nAnalysis: The profits for DO, the retailer, are given as follows:  ProfR = (300,000 - 60,000 p) p - (300,000 - 60,000 p) CR The retailer prices to maximize profits, and the optimal retail price is obtained by setting the first derivative of retailer profits with respect to p to 0.\\nThis implies that  300,000 - 120,000 p + 60,000 CR = 0 or  p = (300,000 + 60,000 CR) / 120,000  .\\nDR = 30,000 - 60,000 p = 60,000 .\\np = (300,000 + 60,000 * 2.85)/120,000 = $3.925  Observe that the retailer\\'s optimal response is to pass through only $0.075 of the $0.15 discount to the customer.\\nThe retailer does not pass through the entire discount.\\nAt the discounted price, DO experiences a demand of DR = 300,000 - 60,000 p = 64,500 This represents an increase of 7.5 percent in demand relative to the base case.\\nIt is optimal here for DO to pass on half the trade promotion discount to the customers.\\nThis action results in a 7.5 percent increase in customer demand.\\nFrom Examples 11-11 and 11-12, observe that the increase in customer demand resulting from a trade promotion (7.5 percent of demand in Example 11-12) is insignificant relative to the increased purchase by the retailer due to forward buying (500 percent from Example 11-11).\\nThe impact of the increase in customer demand may be further dampened by customer behavior.\\nFor many products, such as detergent and toothpaste, most of the increase in customer purchases is a forward buy by the customer; customers are unlikely to start brushing their teeth more frequently  .\\nKey Point Faced with a short-term discount, it is optimal for retailers to pass through only a fraction of the discount to the customer, keeping the rest for themselves.\\nSimultaneously, it is optimal for retailers to increase the purchase lot size and forward buy for future periods.\\nThus, trade promotions often lead to an increase of cycle inventory in a supply chain without a significant increase in customer demand.\\nsimply because they have purchased a lot of toothpaste.\\nFor such products, a trade promotion does not truly increase demand.\\nManufacturers have always struggled with the fact that retailers pass along only a small fraction of a trade discount to the customer.\\nIn a study conducted by Kurt Salmon and Associates, almost a quarter of all distributor inventories in the dry-grocery supply chain could be attributed to forward buying.5 Our previous discussion supports the claim that trade promotions generally increase cycle inventory in a supply chain and hurt performance.\\nThis realization has led many firms, including the world\\'s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, and several manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble, to adopt \"every day low pricing\" (EDLP).\\nHere, the price is fixed over time and no short-term discounts are offered.\\nThis eliminates any incentive for forward buying.\\nAs a result, all stages of the supply chain purchase in quantities that match demand.\\nIn general, the discount passed through by the retailer to the consumer is influenced by the retailer deal elasticity, which is the increase in retail sales per unit discount in price.\\nThe higher the deal elasticity, the more of the discount the retailer is likely to pass through to the consumer.\\nThus, trade promotions by the manufacturer may make sense for products with a high deal elasticity that ensures high pass-through by the retailer, and high holding costs that ensure low forward buying.\\nBlattberg and Neslin (1990) identify paper goods as products with high deal elasticity and holding cost.\\nThey also identify trade promotions as being more effective with strong brands relative to weak brands.\\nTrade promotions may also make sense as a competitive response.\\nIn a category such as cola, some customers are loyal to their brand while others switch depending on the brand being offered at the lowest price.\\nConsider a situation in which one of the competitors, say Pepsi, offers retailers a trade promotion.\\nRetailers increase their purchases of Pepsi and pass through some of the discount to the customer.\\nPrice-sensitive customers increase their purchase of Pepsi.\\nIf a competitor such as Coca-Cola does not respond, it loses some market share in the form of price-sensitive customers.\\nA case can be made that a trade promotion by Coca-Cola is justified in such a setting as a competitive response.\\nObserve that with both competitors offering trade promotions, there is no real increase in demand for either unless customer consumption grows.\\nInventory in the supply chain, however, does increase for both brands.\\nThis is then a situation in which trade promotions are a competitive necessity, but they increase supply chain inventory, leading to reduced profits for all competitors.\\nTrade promotions should be designed so that retailers limit their forward buying and pass along more of the discount to end customers.\\nThe manufacturer\\'s objective is to increase market share and sales without allowing the retailer to forward buy significant amounts.\\nThis outcome can be achieved by offering discounts to the retailer that are based on actual sales to customers rather than the amount purchased by the retailer.\\nThe discount price thus applies to items sold to customers (sell-through) during the promotion, not the quantity purchased by the retailer (sell-in).\\nThis eliminates all incentive for forward buying.\\nGiven the information technology in place, many manufacturers today offer scanner-based promotions by which the retailer receives credit for the promotion discount for every unit sold.\\nAnother option is to limit the allocation to a retailer based on past sales.\\nThis is also an effort to limit the amount that the retailer can forward buy.\\nIt is unlikely, however, that retailers will accept such schemes for weak brands.\\n5 See Kurt Salmon Associates (1993).\\nA multiechelon supply chain has multiple stages and possibly many players at each stage.\\nThe lack of coordination in lot sizing decisions across the supply chain results in high costs and more cycle inventory than required.\\nThe goal in a multiechelon system is to decrease total costs by coordinating orders across the supply chain.\\nConsider a simple multiechelon system with one manufacturer supplying one retailer.\\nAssume that production is instantaneous, so the manufacturer can produce a lot when needed.\\nIf the two stages are not synchronized, the manufacturer may produce a new lot of size Q right after shipping a lot of size Q to the retailer.\\nInventory at the two stages in this case is as shown in Figure 11-6.\\nIn this case, the retailer carries an average inventory of Q/2 and the manufacturer carries an average inventory of about Q.\\nOverall supply chain inventory can be lowered if the manufacturer synchronizes its production to be ready just in time to be shipped to the retailer.\\nIn this case, the manufacturer carries no inventory and the retailer carries an average inventory of Q/2.\\nSynchronization of production and replenishment allows the supply chain to lower total cycle inventory from about 3Q/2 to Q/2.\\nFor a simple multiechelon supply chain with only one player at each stage, ordering policies in which the lot size at each stage is an integer multiple of the lot size at its immediate customer have been shown to be quite close to optimal.\\nWhen lot sizes are integer multiples, coordination of ordering across stages allows for a portion of the delivery to a stage to be cross-docked on to the next stage.\\nThe extent of cross-docking depends on the ratio of the fixed cost of ordering S and the holding cost H at each stage.\\nThe closer this ratio is between two stages, the higher is the optimal percentage of cross-docked product.\\nMunson, Hu, and Rosenblatt (2003) provide optimal order quantities in a multiechelon setting with a single manufacturer supplying a single retailer.\\nIf one party (distributor) in a supply chain supplies multiple parties (retailers) at the next stage of the supply chain, it is important to distinguish retailers with high demand from those with low demand.\\nIn this setting, Roundy (1985) has shown that a near-optimal policy results if  Manufacturer Inventory Q  Retailer lot is shipped  Manufacturer lot arrives  Retailer Inventory Q  Time  Time .\\nDistributor replenishes every two weeks  Retailer shipment is cross-docked Retailer shipment is from inventory  Retailer replenishes every week  Retailer shipment is cross-docked  Retailer replenishes every two weeks  Retailer shipment is cross-docked  .\\nRetailer replenishes every four weeks  retailers are grouped such that all retailers in one group order together and, for any retailer, either the ordering frequency is an integer multiple of the ordering frequency at the distributor or the ordering frequency at the distributor is an integer multiple of the frequency at the retailer.\\nAn integer replenishment policy has every player ordering periodically, with the length of the reorder interval for each player an integer multiple of some base period.\\nAn example of such a policy is shown in Figure 11-7.\\nUnder this policy, the distributor places a replenishment order every two weeks.\\nSome retailers place replenishment orders every week, and others place replenishment orders every two or four weeks.\\nObserve that for retailers ordering more frequently than the distributor, the retailers\\' ordering frequency is an integer multiple of the distributor\\'s frequency.\\nFor retailers ordering less frequently than the distributor, the distributor\\'s ordering frequency is an integer multiple of the retailers\\' frequency.\\nIf an integer replenishment policy is synchronized across the two stages, the distributor can cross-dock part of its supply on to the next stage.\\nAll shipments to retailers ordering no more frequently than the distributor (every two or four weeks) are cross-docked as shown in Figure 11-7.\\nFor retailers ordering more frequently (every week) than the distributor, half the orders are crossdocked, with the other half shipped from inventory as shown in Figure 11-7.\\nInteger replenishment policies for the supply chain shown in Figure 11-8 can be summarized as follows: ?Divide all parties within a stage into groups such that all parties within a group order from the same supplier and have the same reorder interval.\\n?Set reorder intervals across stages such that the receipt of a replenishment order at any stage is synchronized with the shipment of a replenishment order to at least one of its customers.\\nThe synchronized portion can be cross-docked.\\nStage 3  Stage 4  Stage 5  Group of Customers  .\\nKey Point Integer replenishment policies can be synchronized in multiechelon supply chains to keep cycle inventory and order costs low.\\nUnder such policies, the reorder interval at any stage is an integer multiple of a base reorder interval.\\nSynchronized integer replenishment policies facilitate a high level of cross-docking across the supply chain.\\n?For customers with a longer reorder interval than the supplier, make the customer\\'s reorder interval an integer multiple of the supplier\\'s interval and synchronize replenishment at the two stages to facilitate cross-docking.\\nIn other words, a supplier should cross-dock all orders from customers who reorder less frequently than the supplier.\\n?For customers with a shorter reorder interval than the supplier, make the supplier\\'s reorder interval an integer multiple of the customer\\'s interval and synchronize replenishment at the two stages to facilitate cross-docking.\\nIn other words, a supplier should cross-dock one out of every k shipments to a customer who orders more frequently than the supplier, where k is an integer.\\n?The relative frequency of reordering depends on the setup cost, holding cost, and demand at different parties.\\nWhereas the integer policies discussed above synchronize replenishment within the supply chain and decrease cycle inventories, they increase safety inventories, because of the lack of flexibility with the timing of a reorder, as discussed in Chapter 12.\\nThus, these polices make the most sense for supply chains in which cycle inventories are large and demand is relatively predictable.\\nBalance the appropriate costs to choose the optimal lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain.\\nCycle inventory generally equals half the lot size.\\nTherefore, as the lot size grows, so does the cycle inventory.\\nIn deciding on the optimal amount of cycle inventory, the supply chain  .\\ngoal is to minimize the total cost--the order cost, holding cost, and material cost.\\nAs cycle inventory increases, so does the holding cost.\\nHowever, the order cost and, in some instances, the material cost decrease with an increase in lot size and cycle inventory.\\nThe EOQ balances the three costs to obtain the optimal lot size.\\nThe higher the order and transportation cost, the higher the lot size and cycle inventory.\\nUnderstand the impact of quantity discounts on lot size and cycle inventory.\\nLot size苑ased quantity discounts increase the lot size and cycle inventory within the supply chain because they encourage buyers to purchase in larger quantities to take advantage of the decrease in price.\\nDevise appropriate discounting schemes for a supply chain.\\nQuantity discounts are justified to increase total supply chain profits when independent lot-sizing decisions in a supply chain lead to suboptimal solutions from an overall supply chain perspective.\\nIf suppliers have large fixed costs, suitable lot size苑ased quantity discounts can be justified because they help coordinate the supply chain.\\nVolume-based discounts are more effective than lot size苑ased discounts in increasing supply chain profits without increasing lot size and cycle inventory.\\nUnderstand the impact of trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory.\\nTrade promotions increase inventory and total supply chain costs through forward buying, which shifts future demand to the present and creates a spike in demand followed by a dip.\\nThe increased variability raises inventories and costs.\\nIdentify managerial levers that reduce lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain without increasing cost.\\nThe key managerial levers for reducing lot size and thus cycle inventory in the supply chain without increasing cost are the following: ?Reduce fixed ordering and transportation costs incurred per order.\\n?Implement volume-based discounting schemes rather than individual lot size苑ased discounting schemes.\\n?Eliminate or reduce trade promotions and encourage EDLP.\\nBase trade promotions on sell-through rather than sell-in to the retailer.\\n product availability for the customer because the store now runs out of purses only if the demand over the three weeks exceeds 400.\\nGiven an average weekly demand of 100 purses, the store will have an average of 100 purses remaining when the replenishment lot arrives.\\nSafety inventory is the average inventory remaining when the replenishment lot arrives.\\nThus, Bloomingdale\\'s carries a safety inventory of 100 purses.\\nGiven a lot size of Q  600 purses, the cycle inventory, the focus of the previous chapter, is Q2  300 purses.\\nThe inventory profile at Bloomingdale\\'s in the presence of safety inventory is shown in Figure 12-1, which illustrates that the average inventory at Bloomingdale\\'s is the sum of the cycle and safety inventories.\\nThis example illustrates a trade-off that a supply chain manager must consider when planning safety inventory.\\nOn one hand, raising the level of safety inventory increases product availability and thus the margin captured from customer purchases.\\nOn the other hand, raising the level of safety inventory increases inventory holding costs.\\nThis issue is particularly significant in industries in which product life cycles are short and demand is volatile.\\nCarrying excessive inventory can help counter demand volatility but can really hurt if new products come on the market and demand for the product in inventory dries up.\\nThe inventory on hand then becomes worthless.\\nIn today\\'s business environment, it has become easier for customers to search across stores for product availability.\\nIf Amazon is out of a title, a customer can easily check to see if barnesandnoble.com has the title available.\\nThe increased ease of searching puts pressure on firms to improve product availability.\\nSimultaneously, product variety has grown with increased customization.\\nAs a result, markets have become increasingly heterogeneous and demand for individual products is unstable and difficult to forecast.\\nBoth the increased variety and the greater pressure for availability push firms to raise the level of safety inventory they hold.\\nGiven the product variety and high demand uncertainty in most high-tech supply chains, a significant fraction of the inventory carried is safety inventory.\\nAs product variety has grown, however, product life cycles have shrunk.\\nThus, it is more likely that a product that is \"hot\" today will be obsolete tomorrow, which increases the cost to firms of carrying too much inventory.\\nThus, a key to the success of any supply chain is to figure out ways to decrease the level of safety inventory carried without hurting the level of product availability.\\nThe importance of reduced safety inventories is emphasized by the experience of Nordstrom, Macy\\'s, and Saks during the 2008?009 recession.\\nNordstrom outperformed the other two chains by moving its inventories about twice as fast as its competitors.\\nIn 2008 (2009), Nordstrom carried an average of about 2 (2) months, Macy\\'s carried about 4 (4.15) months, and Saks carried about 4.24 (4.67) months of inventory.\\nA key to Nordstrom\\'s success has been its ability to provide a high level of product availability to customers while carrying low levels of  .\\nsafety inventory in its supply chain.\\nThis fact has also played an important role in the success of Zara, Wal-Mart, and Seven-Eleven Japan.\\nFor any supply chain, three key questions need to be considered when planning safety inventory: 1.\\nWhat is the appropriate level of product availability?\\nHow much safety inventory is needed for the desired level of product availability?\\nWhat actions can be taken to improve product availability while reducing safety inventory?\\nThe first question is discussed in detail in Chapter 13.\\nThe remainder of this chapter focuses on answering the second and third questions assuming a desired level of product availability.\\nNext, we consider factors that influence the appropriate level of safety inventory.\\nThe appropriate level of safety inventory is determined by the following two factors: ?The uncertainty of both demand and supply ?The desired level of product availability As the uncertainty of supply or demand grows, the required level of safety inventories increases.\\nConsider the sale of smart phones at B&M Office Supplies.\\nWhen a new smart phone model is introduced, demand is highly uncertain.\\nB&M thus carries a much higher level of safety inventory relative to demand.\\nAs the market\\'s reaction to the new model becomes clearer, uncertainty is reduced and demand is easier to predict.\\nAt that point, B&M can carry a lower level of safety inventory relative to demand.\\nAs the desired level of product availability increases, the required level of safety inventory also increases.\\nIf B&M targets a higher level of product availability for the new phone model, it must carry a higher level of safety inventory for that model.\\nNext, we discuss some measures of demand uncertainty.\\nMeasuring Demand Uncertainty As discussed in Chapter 7, demand has a systematic as well as a random component.\\nThe goal of forecasting is to predict the systematic component and estimate the random component.\\nThe random component is usually estimated as the standard deviation of forecast error.\\nWe assume the following inputs for demand: D: Average demand per period sD: Standard deviation of demand (forecast error) per period For now, we assume that weekly demand for the phone at B&M is normally distributed, with a mean of D and a standard deviation of sD.\\nEven though standard deviation of demand is not necessarily the same as forecast error we treat the two to be interchangeable in our discussion.\\nSafety inventory calculations should really be based on forecast error.\\nLead time is the gap between when an order is placed and when it is received.\\nIn our discussion, we denote the lead time by L. In the B&M example, L is the time between when B&M orders phones and when they are delivered.\\nIn this case, B&M is exposed to the uncertainty of demand during the lead time.\\nWhether B&M is able to satisfy all demand from inventory depends on the demand for phones experienced during the lead time and the inventory B&M has when a replenishment order is placed.\\nThus, B&M must estimate the uncertainty of demand during the lead time, not just a single period.\\nWe now evaluate the distribution of demand over L periods, given the distribution of demand during each period.\\nEVALUATING DEMAND DISTRIBUTION OVER L PERIODS Assume that demand for each period i, i  1, ..., L is normally distributed with a mean Di and standard deviation si.\\nthe correlation coefficient of demand between periods i and j.\\nIn this case, the total demand during L periods is normally distributed with a mean of DL and a standard deviation of L, where the following is true:  LL  DL = a Di i=1  sL  =  A  a i=1  si2  +  2 a rijsisj i7j  .\\nwhere the following is true:  DL = D*L sL = 1LsD  .\\nAnother important measure of uncertainty is the coefficient of variation (cv), which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\\nGiven demand with a mean of m and a standard deviation of s, we have cv = s>m  The coefficient of variation measures the size of the uncertainty relative to demand.\\nIt captures the fact that a product with a mean demand of 100 and a standard deviation of 100 has greater demand uncertainty than a product with a mean demand of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 100.\\nConsidering the standard deviation alone cannot capture this difference.\\nNext, we discuss some measures of product availability.\\nMeasuring Product Availability Product availability reflects a firm\\'s ability to fill a customer order out of available inventory.\\nA stockout results if a customer order arrives when product is not available.\\nThere are several ways to measure product availability.\\nSome of the important measures are listed next.\\nProduct fill rate (fr) is the fraction of product demand that is satisfied from product in inventory.\\nFill rate is equivalent to the probability that product demand is supplied from available inventory.\\nFill rate should be measured over specified amounts of demand rather than time.\\nThus, it is more appropriate to measure fill rate over every million units of demand rather than every month.\\nAssume that B&M provides smart phones to 90 percent of its customers from inventory, with the remaining 10 percent lost to a neighboring competitor because of a lack of available inventory.\\nIn this case, B&M achieves a fill rate of 90 percent.\\nOrder fill rate is the fraction of orders that are filled from available inventory.\\nOrder fill rate should also be measured over a specified number of orders rather than time.\\nIn a multiproduct scenario, an order is filled from inventory only if all products in the order can be supplied from the available inventory.\\nIn the case of B&M, a customer may order a phone along with a laptop.\\nThe order is filled from inventory only if both the phone and the laptop are available through the store.\\nOrder fill rates tend to be lower than product fill rates because all products must be in stock for an order to be filled.\\nCycle service level (CSL) is the fraction of replenishment cycles that end with all the customer demand being met.\\nA replenishment cycle is the interval between two successive replenishment deliveries.\\nThe CSL is equal to the probability of not having a stockout in a replenishment cycle.\\nCSL should be measured over a specified number of replenishment cycles.\\nIf B&M orders replenishment lots of 600 phones, the interval between the arrival of two successive replenishment lots is a replenishment cycle.\\nIf the manager at B&M manages inventory such that the store does not run out of inventory in 6 out of 10 replenishment cycles, the store achieves a CSL of 60 percent.\\nObserve that a CSL of 60 percent typically results in a much higher fill rate.\\nIn the 60 percent of cycles in which B&M does not run out of inventory, all  .\\ncustomer demand is satisfied from available inventory.\\nIn the 40 percent of cycles in which a stockout does occur, most of the customer demand is satisfied from inventory.\\nOnly the small fraction toward the end of the cycle that arrives after B&M is out of inventory is lost.\\nAs a result, the fill rate is much higher than 60 percent.\\nThe distinction between product fill rate and order fill rate is usually not significant in a singleproduct situation.\\nWhen a firm is selling multiple products, however, this difference may be significant.\\nFor example, if most orders include 10 or more products that are to be shipped, an out-of-stock situation of one product results in the order not being filled from stock.\\nThe firm in this case may have a poor order fill rate even though it has good product fill rates.\\nTracking order fill rates is important when customers place a high value on the entire order being filled simultaneously.\\nNext, we describe two replenishment policies that are often used in practice.\\nReplenishment Policies A replenishment policy consists of decisions regarding when to reorder and how much to reorder.\\nThese decisions determine the cycle and safety inventories along with the fill rate fr and the cycle service level CSL.\\nReplenishment policies may take any of several forms.\\nWe restrict attention to two types: 1.\\nContinuous review: Inventory is continuously tracked, and an order for a lot size Q is placed when the inventory declines to the reorder point (ROP).\\nAs an example, consider the store manager at B&M who continuously tracks the inventory of phones.\\nShe orders 600 phones when the inventory drops below ROP  400.\\nIn this case, the size of the order does not change from one order to the next.\\nThe time between orders may fluctuate given variable demand.\\nPeriodic review: Inventory status is checked at regular periodic intervals, and an order is placed to raise the inventory level to a specified threshold.\\nAs an example, consider the purchase of film at B&M.\\nThe store manager does not track film inventory continuously.\\nEvery Thursday, employees check film inventory, and the manager orders enough so that the total of the available inventory and the size of the order equals 1,000 films.\\nIn this case, the time between orders is fixed.\\nThe size of each order, however, can fluctuate given variable demand.\\nThese inventory policies are not comprehensive but suffice to illustrate the key managerial issues concerning safety inventories.\\nEvaluating Cycle Service Level and Fill Rate Given a Replenishment Policy .\\nExpected demand during lead time = D*L  Given that the store manager places a replenishment order when ROP phones are on hand, we have  Safety inventory, ss = ROP - DL  .\\nThis is because, on average, D*L phones will sell over the L weeks between when the order is placed and when the lot arrives.\\nThe average inventory when the replenishment lot arrives will thus be ROP - D*L. The evaluation of safety inventory for a given inventory policy is described in Example 12-1.  .\\nEXAMPLE 12-1 Evaluating Safety Inventory Given an Inventory Policy Assume that weekly demand for phones at B&M Office Supplies is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe manufacturer takes two weeks to fill an order placed by the B&M manager.\\nThe store manager currently orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000.\\nEvaluate the safety inventory and the average inventory carried by B&M.\\nAlso evaluate the average time a phone spends at B&M.\\nAnalysis: Under this replenishment policy, we have Average demand per week, D  2,500 Standard deviation of weekly demand, sD = 500 Average lead time for replenishment, L  2 weeks Reorder point, ROP  6,000 Average lot size, Q  10,000 .\\nB&M thus carries a safety inventory of 1,000 phones.\\nFrom Chapter 11, recall that Cycle inventory = Q>2 = 10,000>2 = 5,000 We thus have Average inventory = cycle inventory + safety inventory = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 B&M thus carries an average of 6,000 phones in inventory.\\nUsing Little\\'s law (Equation 3.1), we have Average flow time = average inventory>throughput = 6,000>2,500 = 2.4 weeks Each phone thus spends an average of 2.4 weeks at B&M.\\nNext, we discuss how to evaluate the CSL given a replenishment policy.\\nEVALUATING CYCLE SERVICE LEVEL GIVEN A REPLENISHMENT POLICY Given a replenishment policy, our goal is to evaluate CSL, the probability of not stocking out in a replenishment cycle.\\nWe return to B&M\\'s continuous review replenishment policy of ordering Q units when the inventory on hand drops to the ROP.\\nThe lead time is L weeks and weekly demand is normally distributed, with a mean of D and a standard deviation of sD.\\nObserve that a stockout occurs in a cycle if demand during the lead time is larger than the ROP.\\nThus, we have  CSL = Prob1demand during lead time of L weeks ... ROP2  To evaluate this probability, we need to obtain the distribution of demand during the lead .\\nthe CSL is  CSL = F1ROP, DL, sL2 = NORMDIST1ROP, DL, sL, 12  .\\nWe now illustrate this evaluation in Example 12-2.  .\\nEXAMPLE 12-2 Evaluating Cycle Service Level Given a Replenishment Policy Weekly demand for phones at B&M is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe replenishment lead time is two weeks.\\nAssume that the demand is independent from one week to the next.\\nEvaluate the CSL resulting from a policy of ordering 10,000 phones when there are 6,000 phones in inventory.\\nAnalysis:  In this case, we have  Q = 10,000, ROP = 6,000, L = 2 weeks  D = 2,500/week, sD = 500  Observe that B&M runs the risk of stocking out during the lead time of two weeks between when an order is placed and when the replenishment arrives.\\nThus, whether or not a stockout occurs depends on the demand during the lead time of two weeks.\\nDL = D*L = 2 * 2,500 = 5,000 sL = 1LsD = 12 * 500 = 707  .\\nCSL = F1ROP, DL, sL2 = NORMDIST1ROP, DL, sL, 12 = NORMDIST16,000, 5,000, 707, 12 = 0.92  A CSL of 0.92 implies that in 92 percent of the replenishment cycles, B&M supplies all demand from available inventory.\\nIn the remaining 8 percent of the cycles, stockouts occur and some demand is not satisfied because of the lack of inventory.\\nNext, we discuss the evaluation of the fill rate given a replenishment policy.\\nEVALUATING FILL RATE GIVEN A REPLENISHMENT POLICY Recall that fill rate measures the proportion of customer demand that is satisfied from available inventory.\\nFill rate is generally a more relevant measure than cycle service level because it allows the retailer to estimate the fraction of demand that is turned into sales.\\nThe two measures are closely related, as raising the cycle service level also raises the fill rate for a firm.\\nOur discussion focuses on evaluating fill rate for a continuous review policy under which Q units are ordered when the quantity on hand drops to the ROP.\\nTo evaluate the fill rate, it is important to understand the process by which a stockout occurs during a replenishment cycle.\\nA stockout occurs if the demand during the lead time exceeds the ROP.\\nWe thus need to evaluate the average amount of demand in excess of the ROP in each replenishment cycle.\\nThe expected shortage per replenishment cycle (ESC) is the average units of demand that are not satisfied from inventory in stock per replenishment cycle.\\nGiven a lot size of Q (which is also the average demand in a replenishment cycle), the fraction of demand lost is thus ESC>Q.\\nThe product fill rate fr is thus given by  fr = 1 - ESC>Q = 1Q - ESC2>Q  .\\nA shortage occurs in a replenishment cycle only if the demand during the lead time  exceeds the ROP.\\nLet f(x) be the density function of the demand distribution during the lead time.\\nThe ESC is given by  q  ESC =  1x - ROP2 f1x2dx  Lx = ROP  .\\nESC  =  -ss c1  -  Fs  a  ss sL  b  d  +  sLfs  a  ss sL  b  .\\nESC = - ss[1 - NORMDIST1ss>sL, 0, 1, 12] + sL NORMDIST1ss>sL, 0, 1, 02  .\\nEXAMPLE 12-3 Evaluating Fill Rate Given a Replenishment Policy From Example 12-2, recall that weekly demand for phones at B&M is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe replenishment lead time is two weeks.\\nAssume that the demand is independent from one week to the next.\\nEvaluate the fill rate resulting from the policy of ordering 10,000 phones when there are 6,000 phones in inventory.\\nAnalysis: From the analysis of Example 12-2, we have Lot size, Q  10,000 Average demand during lead time, DL  5,000 Standard deviation of demand during lead time, sL = 707 .\\nESC = -1,000[1 - NORMDIST11,000>707, 0, 1, 12] + 707 NORMDIST11,000/707, 0, 1, 02 = 25 .\\nfr = 1Q - ESC2>Q = 110,000 - 252>10,000 = 0.9975 In other words, 99.75 percent of the demand is filled from inventory in stock.\\nThis is much higher than the CSL of 92 percent that resulted in Example 12-2 for the same replenishment policy.\\nAll the calculations for Example 12-3 may be done easily in Excel, as shown in Figure 12-2.\\nA few key observations should be made.\\nFirst, observe that the fill rate (0.9975) in Example 12-3 is significantly higher than the CSL (0.92) in Example 12-2 for the same replenishment policy.\\nNext, by rerunning the examples with a different lot size, we can observe the impact of lot-size changes on the service level.\\nIncreasing the lot size of phones from 10,000 to 20,000 has no impact on the CSL (which stays at 0.92).\\nThe fill rate, however, now increases  .\\nCell  Cell Formula  Equation  A6 =B3*D3  .\\nThis happens because an increase in lot size results in fewer replenishment cycles.\\nIn the case of B&M, an increase in lot size from 10,000 to 20,000 results in replenishment occurring once every eight weeks instead of once every four weeks.\\nWith a 92 percent CSL, a lot size of 10,000 results in, on average, one cycle with a stockout per year.\\nWith a lot size of 20,000, we have, on average, one stockout every two years.\\nThus, the fill rate is higher.\\nKey Point Both fill rate and cycle service level increase as the safety inventory is increased.\\nFor the same safety inventory, an increase in lot size increases the fill rate but not the cycle service level.\\nWe now discuss how the appropriate level of safety inventory may be obtained given a desired CSL or fill rate.\\nEvaluating Safety Inventory Given Desired Cycle Service Level or Fill Rate In many practical settings, firms have a desired level of product availability and want to design replenishment polices that achieve this level.\\nFor example, Wal-Mart has a desired level of product availability for each product sold in a store.\\nThe store manager must design a replenishment policy with the appropriate level of safety inventory to meet this goal.\\nThe desired level of product availability may be determined by trading off the cost of holding inventory with the cost of a stockout.\\nThis trade-off is discussed in detail in Chapter 13.\\nIn other instances, the desired level of product availability (in terms of CSL or fill rate) is stated explicitly in contracts, and management must design replenishment policies that achieve the desired target.\\nEVALUATING REQUIRED SAFETY INVENTORY GIVEN DESIRED CYCLE SERVICE LEVEL Our goal is to obtain the appropriate level of safety inventory given the desired CSL.\\nWe assume that a continuous review replenishment policy is followed.\\nConsider the store manager at Wal-Mart responsible for designing replenishment policies for all products in the store.\\nCSL for the basic box of Lego building blocks.\\nGiven a lead time of L, the store manager wants to identify a suitable reorder point ROP and safety inventory that achieves the desired service level.\\nAssume that demand for Legos at Wal-Mart is normally distributed and independent from one week to the next.\\nWe assume the following inputs: .\\nF1DL + ss, DL, sL2 = CSL Given the definition of the inverse normal in Appendix 12A and the equivalent Excel function from Appendix 12B, we obtain DL + ss = F-11CSL, DL, sL2 = NORMINV1CSL, DL, sL2 or ss = F-11CSL, DL, sL2 - DL = NORMINV1CSL, DL, sL2 - DL Using the definition of the standard normal distribution and its inverse from Appendix 12A, and the equivalent Excel function from Appendix 12B, it can also be shown that the following is true: .\\nIn Example 12-4, we illustrate the evaluation of safety inventory given a desired CSL.\\nEXAMPLE 12-4 Evaluating Safety Inventory Given a Desired Cycle Service Level Weekly demand for Legos at a Wal-Mart store is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 boxes and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe replenishment lead time is two weeks.\\nAssuming a continuousreview replenishment policy, evaluate the safety inventory that the store should carry to achieve a CSL of 90 percent.\\nAnalysis: In this case we have .\\nEXAMPLE 12-5 Evaluating Safety Inventory Given Desired Fill Rate Weekly demand for Legos at a Wal-Mart store is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 boxes and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe replenishment lead time is two weeks.\\nThe store manager currently orders replenishment lots of 10,000 boxes from Lego.\\nAssuming a continuous-review replenishment policy, evaluate the safety inventory the store should carry to achieve a fill rate of 97.5 percent.\\nAnalysis: In this case we have  Desired fill rate, fr  0.975 Lot size, Q  10,000 boxes Standard deviation of demand during lead time, sL = 707 .\\nESC = 11 - fr2 Q = 11 - 0.975210,000 = 250  .\\nESC  =  250  =  - ss c 1  -  Fs  a  ss sL  b  d  +  sLfs  a  ss sL  b  =  -ssc1  -  Fs  a  ss 707  b  d  +  707fs  a  ss 707  b  .\\nFirst set up the spreadsheet as shown in Figure 12-3, where cell D3 can have any value for the safety inventory ss.\\nInvoke GOALSEEK using Data | What-If Analysis | Goal Seek.\\nIn the GOALSEEK dialog box, enter the data as shown in Figure 12-3 and click the OK button.\\nIn this case, cell D3 is changed until the value of the formula in cell A6 equals 250.\\nUsing GOALSEEK, we obtain a safety inventory of ss  67 boxes as shown in Figure 12-3.\\nThus, the store manager at Wal-Mart should target a safety inventory of 67 boxes to achieve the desired fill rate of 97.5 percent.\\nCell Cell Formula  Equation  .\\nImpact of Desired Product Availability and Uncertainty on Safety Inventory The two key factors that affect the required level of safety inventory are the desired level of product availability and uncertainty.\\nWe now discuss the impact that each factor has on the safety inventory.\\nAs the desired product availability goes up, the required safety inventory also increases because the supply chain must now be able to accommodate uncommonly high demand or uncommonly low supply.\\nFor the Wal-Mart situation in Example 12-5, we evaluate the required safety inventory for varying levels of fill rate as shown in Table 12-1.\\nObserve that raising the fill rate from 97.5 percent to 98.0 percent requires an additional 116 units of safety inventory, whereas raising the fill rate from 99.0 percent to 99.5 percent requires an additional 268 units of safety inventory.\\nThus, the marginal increase in safety inventory grows as product availability rises.\\nThis phenomenon highlights the importance of selecting suitable product availability levels.\\nIt is important for a supply chain manager to be aware of the products that require a high level of availability and hold high safety inventories only for those products.\\nIt is not appropriate to select a high level of product availability and require it arbitrarily for all products.\\nKey Point The required safety inventory grows rapidly with an increase in the desired product availability.\\nTable 12-1 Required Safety Inventory for Different Values of Fill Rate  Fill Rate  Safety Inventory  97.5% 98.0% 98.5% 99.0% 99.5%  67 183 321 499 767  .\\nKey Point The required safety inventory increases with an increase in the lead time and the standard deviation of periodic demand.\\nA goal of any supply chain manager is to reduce the level of safety inventory required in a way that does not adversely affect product availability.\\nThe previous discussion highlights two key managerial levers that may be used to achieve this goal: 1.\\nReduce the supplier lead time L: If lead time decreases by a factor of k, the required safety inventory decreases by a factor of 1k.\\nThe only caveat here is that reducing the supplier lead time requires significant effort from the supplier, whereas reduction in safety inventory occurs at the retailer.\\nThus, it is important for the retailer to share some of the resulting benefits as discussed in Chapter 10.\\nWal-Mart, Seven-Eleven Japan, and many other retailers apply tremendous pressure on their suppliers to reduce the replenishment lead time.\\nApparel retailer Zara has built its entire strategy around using local flexible production to reduce replenishment lead times.\\nIn each case, the benefit has manifested itself in the form of reduced safety inventory while maintaining the desired level of product availability.\\nReduce the underlying uncertainty of demand (represented by sD): If sD is reduced by a factor of k, the required safety inventory also decreases by a factor of k. A reduction in sD may be achieved by better market intelligence and the use of more sophisticated forecasting methods.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan provides its store managers with detailed data about prior demand along with weather and other factors that may influence demand.\\nThis market intelligence allows the store managers to make better forecasts, reducing uncertainty.\\nIn most supply chains, however, the key to reducing the underlying forecast uncertainty is to link all forecasts throughout the supply chain to customer demand data.\\nA lot of the demand uncertainty exists only because each stage of the supply chain plans and forecasts independently.\\nThis distorts demand throughout the supply chain, increasing uncertainty.\\nImproved coordination, as discussed in Chapter 10, can often reduce the demand uncertainty significantly.\\nZara plans its production and replenishment based on actual sales at its retail stores to ensure that no unnecessary uncertainties are introduced.\\nBoth Wal-Mart and Seven-Eleven Japan share demand information with their suppliers, reducing uncertainty and thus safety inventory within the supply chain.\\nWe illustrate the benefits of reducing lead time and demand uncertainty in Example 12-6.\\nEXAMPLE 12-6 Benefits of Reducing Lead Time and Demand Uncertainty Weekly demand for white shirts at a Target store is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 800.\\nThe replenishment lead time from the current supplier is nine weeks.\\nThe store manager aims for a cycle service level of 95 percent.\\nWhat savings in safety  .\\ninventory can the store expect if the supplier reduces lead time to one week?\\nWhat savings in safety inventory can the store expect if the demand uncertainty is reduced such that the standard deviation of demand is only 400?\\nAnalysis: For the base case we have D = 2,500/week, sD = 800, CSL = 0.95 .\\nss = NORMSINV1CSL2 * 2LsD = NORMSINV1.952 * 19 * 800 = 3,948 If the suppler reduces the lead time L to one week, the required safety inventory is given by ss = NORMSINV1CSL2 * 1LsD = NORMSINV1.952 * 11 * 800 = 1,316 Thus, reducing the lead time from nine weeks to one week reduces the required safety inventory by 2,632 shirts.\\nWe now consider the benefits of reducing forecast error.\\nIf Target reduces the standard deviation from 800 to 400 (for the nine-week lead time), the required safety inventory is obtained as follows: ss = NORMSINV1CSL2 * 1LsD = NORMSINV1.952 * 19 * 400 = 1,974 Thus, reducing the standard deviation (equal to forecast error) of demand from 800 to 400 reduces the required safety inventory by 1,974 shirts.\\nIn our discussion to this point, we have focused on situations with demand uncertainty in the form of a forecast error.\\nIn many practical situations, supply uncertainty also plays a significant role.\\nThe impact of supply uncertainty is well illustrated by the impact of the grounding of MSC Napoli on the south coast of Britain in January 2007.\\nThe container ship was carrying more than 1,000 tons of nickel, a key ingredient of stainless steel.\\nGiven that 1,000 tons was almost 20 percent of the 5,052 tons of nickel then stored in warehouses globally, this delay in bringing nickel to market resulted in significant shortages and raised the price of nickel by about 20 percent in the first 31>2 weeks of January 2007.\\nSupply uncertainty arises because of many factors including production delays, transportation delays, and quality problems.\\nSupply chains must account for supply uncertainty when planning safety inventories.\\nIn this section, we incorporate supply uncertainty by assuming that lead time is uncertain and identify the impact of lead time uncertainty on safety inventories.\\nAssume that the customer demand per period for Dell computers and the replenishment lead time from the component supplier are normally distributed.\\nWe are provided the following inputs: D: Average demand per period sD: Standard deviation of demand per period L: Average lead time for replenishment sL: Standard deviation of lead time We consider the safety inventory requirements given that Dell follows a continuous review policy to manage component inventory.\\nDell experiences a stockout of components if demand during the lead time exceeds the ROP, that is, the quantity on hand when Dell places a replenishment order.\\nThus, we need to identify the distribution of customer demand during the lead time.\\nboth lead time and periodic demand are uncertain, demand during the lead time is normally distributed with a mean of DL and a standard deviation sL, where  DL = D*L sL = 3LsD2 + D2sL2  .\\nEXAMPLE 12-7 Impact of Lead Time Uncertainty on Safety Inventory Daily demand for PCs at Dell is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500.\\nA key component in PC assembly is the hard drive.\\nThe hard drive supplier takes an average of L  7 days to replenish inventory at Dell.\\nDell is targeting a CSL of 90 percent (providing a fill rate close to 100 percent) for its hard drive inventory.\\nEvaluate the safety inventory of hard drives that Dell must carry if the standard deviation of the lead time is seven days.\\nDell is working with the supplier to reduce the standard deviation to zero.\\nEvaluate the reduction in safety inventory that Dell can expect as a result of this initiative.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have Average demand per period, D  2,500 Standard deviation of demand per period, sD = 500 Average lead time for replenishment, L  7 days Standard deviation of lead time, sL = 7 days .\\nMean demand during lead time, DL = D*L = 2,500 * 7 = 17,500 Standard deviation of demand during lead time sL = 1Ls2D + D2s2L = 27 * 5002 + 2,5002 * 72 = 17,550 .\\nss = FS-1 1CSL2 * sL = NORMSINV1CSL2 * sL = NORMSINV10.902 * 17,550 = 22,491 hard drives If the standard deviation of lead time is seven days, Dell must carry a safety inventory of 22,491 drives.\\nObserve that this is equivalent to about nine days of demand for hard drives.\\nIn Table 12-2, we provide the required safety inventory as Dell works with the supplier to reduce standard deviation of lead time (sL) from six down to zero.\\nFrom Table 12-2, observe that the reduction in lead time uncertainty allows Dell to reduce its safety inventory of hard drives by a significant amount.\\nAs the standard deviation of lead time declines from seven days to zero, the amount of safety inventory declines from about nine days of demand to less than a day of demand.\\nThe preceding example emphasizes the impact of lead time variability on safety inventory requirements (and thus material flow time) and the large potential benefits from reducing lead time variability or improving on-time deliveries.\\nOften, safety inventory calculations in practice do not include any measure of supply uncertainty, resulting in levels that may be lower than required.\\nThis hurts product availability.\\nTable 12-2 Required Safety Inventory as a Function of Lead Time Uncertainty  sL  L  ss (units)  ss (days)  6 15,058 5 12,570 4 10,087 3 7,616 2 5,172 1 2,828 0 1,323  19,298 16,109 12,927 9,760 6,628 3,625 1,695  7.72 6.44 5.17 3.90 2.65 1.45 0.68  Key Point A reduction in supply uncertainty can help dramatically reduce safety inventory required without hurting product availability.\\nIn practice, variability of supply lead time is caused by practices at both the supplier as well as the party receiving the order.\\nSuppliers sometimes have poor planning tools that do not allow them to schedule production in a way that can be executed.\\nToday, most supply chain planning software suites have good production planning tools that allow suppliers to promise lead times that can be met.\\nThis helps reduce lead time variability.\\nIn other instances, the behavior of the party placing the order often increases lead time variability.\\nIn one instance, a distributor placed orders to all suppliers on the same day of the week.\\nAs a result, all deliveries arrived on the same day of the week.\\nThe surge in deliveries made it impossible for all of them to be recorded into inventory on the day they arrived.\\nThis led to a perception that supply lead times were long and variable.\\nJust by leveling out the orders over the week, the lead time and the lead time variability were significantly reduced, allowing the distributor to reduce its safety inventory.\\nNext, we discuss how aggregation can help reduce the amount of safety inventory in the supply chain.\\nIn practice, supply chains have varying degrees of inventory aggregation.\\nFor example, Barnes & Noble sells books and music from retail stores with inventory geographically distributed across the country.\\nAmazon, in contrast, ships all its books and music from a few facilities.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan has many small convenience stores densely distributed across Japan.\\nIn contrast, supermarkets tend to be much larger, with fewer outlets that are not as densely distributed.\\nRedbox rents its movies from tens of thousands of kiosks distributed across the United States.\\nIn contrast, Netflix centralizes its DVD inventory at fewer than 60 distribution centers.\\nOur goal is to understand how aggregation in each of these cases affects forecast accuracy and safety inventories.\\nConsider k regions, with demand in each region normally distributed with the following characteristics: Di: Mean weekly demand in region i, i  1, .\\n., k si: Standard deviation of weekly demand in region i, i  1, .\\n., k rij: Correlation of weekly demand for regions i, j, 1 ... i Z j ... k  .\\ni=1  If all inventories are aggregated in a central location, we need to evaluate the distribution of aggregated demand.\\nThe aggregate demand is normally distributed, with a mean of DC, standard deviation of sDC, and a variance of var(DC) as follows:  k  DC  =  a  k i=  1Di;  var1DC2 = a si2 + 2 a rijsisj; i=1 i7j  sDC = 3var1DC2  .\\nDC = kD sCD = 1ksD  .\\nRequired safety inventory on aggregation = FS-11CSL2 * 1L * sCD  .\\nHolding-cost savings on aggregation per unit sold  =  FS-11CSL2 * 1L * H DC  k  *  a a si i=1  -  sDC b  .\\nit  follows  that  the  difference  A  a  k i=  1si  -  sCD B  is  influenced  by  the correlation coefficients ij.\\nThis difference is large when the correlation coefficients are  close to 1 (negative correlation) and shrinks as they approach 1 (positive correlation).\\nInventory savings on aggregation are always positive as long as the correlation coefficients are  .\\nof aggregation:  ?The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the desired cycle service level CSL.\\n?The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the replenishment lead time L. ?The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the holding cost H. ?The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the coefficient of variation of demand.\\n?The safety inventory savings on aggregation decrease as the correlation coefficients increase.\\nIn Example 12-8, we illustrate the inventory savings on aggregation and the impact of the correlation coefficient on these savings.\\nEXAMPLE 12-8 Impact of Correlation on Value of Aggregation A BMW dealership has four retail outlets serving the entire Chicago area (disaggregate option).\\nWeekly demand at each outlet is normally distributed, with a mean of D  25 cars and a standard deviation of sD = 5.\\nThe lead time for replenishment from the manufacturer is L  2 weeks.\\nEach outlet covers a separate geographic area, and the correlation of demand across any pair of areas is r. The dealership is considering the possibility of replacing the four outlets with a single large outlet (aggregate option).\\nAssume that the demand in the central outlet is the sum of the demand across all four areas.\\nThe dealership is targeting a CSL of 0.90.\\nCompare the level of safety inventory needed in the two options as the correlation coefficient  varies between 0 and 1.\\nAnalysis: We provide a detailed analysis for the case when demand in each area is independent (i.e., r = 0).\\nFor each retail outlet we have Standard deviation of weekly demand, sD = 5.\\nReplenishment lead time, L = 2 weeks .\\nTotal required safety inventory, ss = k * Fs-11CSL2 * 1L * sD = 4 * Fs-110.92 * 12 * 5 = 4 * NORMSINV10.92 * 12 * 5 = 36.24 cars .\\nStandard deviation of weekly demand at central outlet, sDC = 14 * 5 = 10 .\\nss = Fs-110.902 * 1L * sCD = NORMSINV10.902 * 12 * 10 = 18.12 .\\nExample 12-8 and the previous discussion demonstrate that aggregation reduces demand uncertainty and thus the required safety inventory as long as the demand being aggregated is not perfectly positively correlated.\\nDemand for most products does not show perfect positive correlation across different geographic regions.\\nProducts such as heating oil are likely to have demand that is positively correlated across nearby regions.\\nIn contrast, products such as milk and sugar are likely to have demand that is much more independent across regions.\\nIf demand in different geographic regions is about the same size and independent, aggregation reduces safety inventory by the square root of the number of areas aggregated.\\nIn other words, if the number of independent stocking locations decreases by a factor of n, the average safety inventory is expected to decrease by a factor of 1n.\\nThis principle is referred to as the square-root law and is illustrated in Figure 12-4.\\nTable 12-3 Safety Inventory in the Disaggregate and Aggregate Options    Disaggregate Safety Inventory  Aggregate Safety Inventory  0 36.24 0.2 36.24 0.4 36.24 0.6 36.24 0.8 36.24 1.0 36.24  18.12 22.92 26.88 30.32 33.41 36.24  .\\nTotal Safety Inventory  .\\nNumber of Independent Stocking Locations  Most online retailers exploit the benefits of aggregation in terms of reduced inventories.\\nFor example, Blue Nile sells diamonds online and serves the entire United States out of one warehouse.\\nAs a result, it has lower levels of diamond inventories than jewelry chains such as Tiffany and Zales, which must keep inventory in every retail store.\\nThere are, however, situations where physical aggregation of inventories in one location may not be optimal.\\nThere are two major disadvantages of aggregating all inventories in one location: 1.\\nIncrease in response time to customer order 2.\\nIncrease in transportation cost to customer Both disadvantages result because the average distance between the inventory and the customer increases with aggregation.\\nEither the customer has to travel farther to reach the product or the product has to be shipped over longer distances to reach the customer.\\nA retail chain such as Gap has the option of building many small retail outlets or a few large ones.\\nGap tends to have many smaller outlets distributed evenly in a region because this strategy reduces the distance that customers travel to reach a store.\\nIf Gap had one large centralized outlet, the average distance that customers need to travel would increase and thus the response time would increase.\\nA desire to decrease customer response time is thus the impetus for the firm to have multiple outlets.\\nAnother example is McMaster-Carr, a distributor of MRO supplies.\\nMcMaster-Carr uses UPS for shipping product to customers.\\nBecause shipping charges are based on distance, having one centralized warehouse increases the average shipping cost as well as the response time to the customer.\\nThus, McMaster-Carr has five warehouses that allow it to provide next-day delivery to a large fraction of the United States.\\nNext-day delivery by UPS would not be feasible at a reasonable cost if McMaster-Carr had only one warehouse.\\nEven Amazon, which started with one warehouse in Seattle, has added more warehouses in other parts of the United States in an effort to improve response time and reduce transportation cost to the customer.\\nWe illustrate the trade-offs of centralization in Example 12-9.\\nEXAMPLE 12-9 Trade-offs of Physical Centralization An online retailer is debating whether to serve the United States through four regional distribution centers or one national distribution center.\\nWeekly demand in each region is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\\nDemand experienced in each region is independent, and supply lead time is four weeks.\\nThe online retailer has a holding cost of 20 percent and the cost of each product is $1,000.\\nThe retailer promises its customers next-day delivery.\\nWith four regional distribution centers, the retailer can provide next-day delivery using ground transportation at a cost of $10/unit.\\nWith a single national distribution center, the retailer  .\\nwill have to use a more expensive mode of transport that will cost $13/unit for next-day service.\\nBuilding and operating four regional DCs costs $150,000 per year more than building and operating one national distribution center.\\nWhat distribution network do you recommend?\\nAssume a desired CSL of 0.95.\\nAnalysis: Observe that centralization decreases facility and inventory costs but increases transportation costs.\\nWe thus evaluate the change in each cost category on aggregation.\\nWe start with inventory costs.\\nFor each region we have D = 1,000>week, sD = 300, L = 4 weeks .\\nTotal required safety inventory, ss = 4 * Fs-11CSL2 * 1L * sD = 4 * NORMSINV10.952 * 14 * 300 = 3,948 .\\nss = Fs-110.952 * 1L * sDC = NORMSINV10.952 * 14 * 600 = 1,974 We can now evaluate the changes in inventory, transportation, and facility costs upon aggregation as follows: Decrease in annual inventory holding cost on aggregation = (3,948 -1,974) * $1,000 * 0.2 = $394,765 Decrease in annual facility costs on aggregation = $150,000 Increase in annual transportation costs on aggregation = 52 * 1,000 * (13 - 10) = $624,000 Observe that in this case the annual costs for the online retailer increase by $624,000 ?$394,765 ?$150,000  $79,235 upon aggregation.\\nThe online retailer is better off with four regional distribution centers.\\nExample 12-9 and the previous discussion highlight instances in which physical aggregation of inventory at one location may not be optimal.\\nHowever, aggregating safety inventory has clear benefits.\\nWe now discuss various methods by which a supply chain can extract the benefits of aggregation without having to physically centralize all inventories in one location.\\nInformation Centralization Redbox uses information centralization to virtually aggregate its inventories of DVDs despite having tens of thousands of vending machines.\\nThe company has set up an online system that allows customers to locate nearby vending machines with the DVD they are searching for in stock.\\nThis allows Redbox to provide a much higher level of product availability than would be possible if a customer found out about availability only by visiting a vending machine.\\nThe benefit of information centralization derives from the fact that most customers get their DVD from the vending machine closest to their house.\\nIn case of a stockout at the closest vending machine, the customer is served from another vending machine, thus improving product availability without adding to inventories.\\nRetailers such as Gap also use information centralization effectively.\\nIf a store does not have the size or color that a customer wants, store employees can use their information system to inform the customer of the closest store with the product in inventory.\\nCustomers can then either go to this store or have the product delivered to their house.\\nGap thus uses information centralization to virtually aggregate inventory across all retail stores even though the inventory is physically separated.\\nThis allows Gap to reduce the amount of safety inventory it carries while providing a high level of product availability.\\nWal-Mart has an information system in place that allows store managers to search other stores for an excess of items that may be hot sellers at their stores.\\nWal-Mart provides transportation that allows store managers to exchange products so they arrive at stores where they are in high demand.\\nIn this case, Wal-Mart uses information centralization with a responsive transportation system to reduce the amount of safety inventory carried while providing a high level of product availability.\\nSpecialization Most supply chains provide a variety of products to customers.\\nWhen inventory is carried at multiple locations, a key decision for a supply chain manager is whether all products should be stocked at every location.\\nClearly, a product that does not sell in a geographic region should not be carried in inventory by the warehouse or retail store located there.\\nFor example, it does not make sense for a Sears retail store in southern Florida to carry a wide variety of snow boots in inventory.\\nAnother important factor that must be considered when making stocking decisions is the reduction in safety inventory that results from aggregation.\\nIf aggregation reduces the required safety inventory for a product by a large amount, it is better to carry the product in one central location.\\nIf aggregation reduces the required safety inventory for a product by a small amount, it may be best to carry the product in multiple decentralized locations to reduce response time and transportation cost.\\nThe reduction in safety inventory due to aggregation is strongly influenced by the demand\\'s coefficient of variation.\\nFor a product with a low coefficient of variation, disaggregate demand can be forecast with accuracy.\\nAs a result, the benefit from aggregation is minimal.\\nFor a product with a high coefficient of variation of demand, disaggregate demand is difficult to forecast.\\nIn this case, aggregation improves forecast accuracy significantly, providing great benefits.\\nWe illustrate this idea in Example 12-10.\\nEXAMPLE 12-10 Impact of Coefficient of Variation on Value of Aggregation Assume that W.W. Grainger, a supplier of MRO products, has 1,600 stores distributed throughout the United States.\\nConsider two products--large electric motors and industrial cleaners.\\nLarge electric motors are high-value items with low demand, whereas the industrial cleaner is a low-value item with high demand.\\nEach motor costs $500 and each can of cleaner costs $30.\\nWeekly demand for motors at each store is normally distributed, with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 40.\\nWeekly demand for cleaner at each store is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 100.\\nDemand experienced by each store is independent, and supply lead time for both motors and cleaner is four weeks.\\nW.W. Grainger has a holding cost of 25 percent.\\nFor each of the two products, evaluate the reduction in safety inventories that will result if they are removed from retail stores and carried only in a centralized DC.\\nAssume a desired CSL of 0.95.\\nAnalysis: The evaluation of safety inventories and the value of aggregation for each of the two products is shown in Table 12-4.\\nAll calculations use the approach discussed earlier and illustrated in  .\\nTable 12-4 Value of Aggregation at W.W. Grainger  Motors  Inventory is stocked in each store Mean weekly demand per store Standard deviation Coefficient of variation Safety inventory per store Total safety inventory Value of safety inventory Inventory is aggregated at the DC Mean weekly aggregate demand Standard deviation of aggregate demand Coefficient of variation Aggregate safety inventory Value of safety inventory Savings Total inventory saving on aggregation Total holding cost saving on aggregation Holding cost saving per unit sold Savings as a percentage of product cost  20 40 2.0 132 211,200 $105,600,000 32,000 1,600 0.05 5,264 $2,632,000 $102,968,000 $25,742,000 $15.47 3.09%  Cleaner 1,000 100 0.1 329 526,400 $15,792,000 1,600,000 4,000 0.0025 13,159 $394,770 $15,397,230 $3,849,308 $0.046 0.15%  Example 12-8.\\nAs Table 12-4 shows, the inventory reduction benefit from centralizing motors is much larger than the benefit from centralizing cleaner.\\nFrom this analysis, W.W. Grainger should stock cleaner at the stores and motors in the DC.\\nGiven that cleaner is a high-demand item, customers will be able to pick it up on the same day at the stores.\\nGiven that motors are a low-demand item, customers may be willing to wait the extra day that shipping from the DC will entail.\\nKey Point The higher the coefficient of variation of an item, the greater is the reduction in safety inventories as a result of centralization.\\nItems with low demand are referred to as slow-moving items and typically have a high coefficient of variation, whereas items with high demand are referred to as fast-moving items and typically have a low coefficient of variation.\\nFor many supply chains, specializing the distribution network with fast-moving items stocked at decentralized locations close to the customer and slow-moving items stocked at a centralized location can significantly reduce the safety inventory carried without hurting customer response time or adding to transportation costs.\\nThe centralized location then specializes in handling slow-moving items.\\nOf course, other factors also need to be considered when deciding on the allocation of products to stocking locations.\\nFor example, an item that is considered an emergency item because the customer needs it urgently may be stocked at stores even if it has a high coefficient of variation.\\nOne also needs to consider the cost of the item.\\nHigh-value items provide a greater benefit from centralization than do low-value items.\\nIt is important for firms with bricks-and-mortar stores to take the idea of specialization into account when they design their online strategy.\\nConsider, for example, a bookstore chain such as Barnes & Noble, which carries about 100,000 titles at each retail store.\\nThe titles carried can be divided into two broad categories--best sellers with high demand and other books with much lower demand.\\nBarnes & Noble can design an online strategy under which the retail stores carry primarily best sellers in inventory.\\nThey also carry one or at most two copies of each of the other titles, to allow customers to browse.\\nCustomers can access all titles that are not in the store via electronic kiosks in the store, which provide access to barnesandnoble.com inventory.\\nThis strategy allows customers to access an increased variety of books from Barnes & Noble stores.\\nCustomers place orders for low-volume titles with barnesandnoble.com while purchasing high-volume titles at the store itself.\\nThis strategy of specialization allows Barnes & Noble to aggregate all slow-moving items to be sold by the online channel.\\nAll best sellers are decentralized and carried close to the customer.\\nThe supply chain thus reduces inventory costs for slow-moving items at the expense of somewhat higher transportation costs.\\nFor the fast-moving items, the supply chain provides a lower transportation cost and better response time by carrying the items at retail stores close to the customer.\\nGap follows a similar strategy and integrates its online channel with its retail stores.\\nTerminals are available at the retail stores for placing orders online.\\nThe retail stores carry fast-moving items, and the customer is able to order slow-moving colors or sizes online.\\nGap is thus able to increase the variety of products available to customers while keeping supply chain inventories down.\\nWalmart.com has also employed a strategy of carrying slower-moving items online.\\nProduct Substitution Substitution refers to the use of one product to satisfy demand for a different product.\\nSubstitution may occur in two situations: 1.\\nManufacturer-driven substitution: The manufacturer or supplier makes the decision to substitute.\\nTypically, the manufacturer substitutes a higher-value product for a lower-value product that is not in inventory.\\nFor example, Dell may install a 1.2 terabyte hard drive into a customer order requiring a 1 terabyte drive, if the smaller drive is out of stock.\\nCustomer-driven substitution: Customers make the decision to substitute.\\nFor example, a customer walking into a Wal-Mart store to buy a gallon of detergent may buy the halfgallon size if the gallon size is not available.\\nThe customer substitutes the half-gallon size for the gallon size.\\nIn both cases, exploiting substitution allows the supply chain to satisfy demand using aggregate inventories, which permits the supply chain to reduce safety inventories without hurting product availability.\\nIn general, given two products or components, substitution may be one-way (i.e., only one of the products [components] substitutes for the other) or two-way (i.e., either product [component] substitutes for the other).\\nWe briefly discuss one-way substitution in the context of manufacturer-driven substitution and two-way substitution in the context of customerdriven substitution.\\nMANUFACTURER-DRIVEN ONE-WAY SUBSTITUTION Consider a PC manufacturer selling direct to customers that offers drives that vary in size from 100 to 300 gigabytes.\\nCustomers are charged according to the size of drive that they select, with larger sizes being more expensive.\\nIf a customer orders a 200-gigabyte drive and the PC manufacturer is out of drives of this size, there are two possible choices: (1) delay or deny the customer order or (2) substitute a larger drive that is in stock (say, a 220-gigabyte drive) and fill the customer order on time.\\nThe first case is potentially a lost sale or loss of future sales because the customer experiences a delayed delivery.\\nIn the second case, the manufacturer installs a higher-cost component, reducing the company\\'s profit margin.\\nThese factors, along with the fact that only larger drives can substitute for smaller drives, must be considered when the manufacturer makes inventory decisions for individual drive sizes.\\nSubstitution allows the PC manufacturer to aggregate demand across the components, reducing safety inventories required.\\nThe value of substitution increases as demand uncertainty increases.\\nThus, the PC manufacturer should consider substitution for components displaying high demand uncertainty.\\nThe desired degree of substitution is influenced by the cost differential between the highervalue and lower-value component.\\nIf the cost differential is very small, the PC manufacturer should aggregate most of the demand and carry most of its inventory in the form of the highervalue component.\\nAs the cost differential increases, the benefit of substitution decreases.\\nIn this case, the PC manufacturer will find it more profitable to carry inventory of each of the two components and decrease the amount of substitution.\\nThe desired level of substitution is also influenced by the correlation of demand between the products.\\nIf demand between two components is strongly positively correlated, there is little value in substitution.\\nAs demand for the two components becomes less positively correlated (or even negatively correlated), the benefit of substitution increases.\\nKey Point Manufacturer-driven substitution increases overall profitability for the manufacturer by allowing some aggregation of demand, which reduces the inventory requirements for the same level of availability.\\nCUSTOMER-DRIVEN TWO-WAY SUBSTITUTION Consider W.W. Grainger selling two brands of motors, GE and SE, which have similar performance characteristics.\\nCustomers are generally willing to purchase either brand, depending on product availability.\\nIf W.W. Grainger managers do not recognize customer substitution, they will not encourage it.\\nFor a given level of product availability, they will thus have to carry high levels of safety inventory of each brand.\\nIf its managers recognize and encourage customer substitution, they can aggregate the safety inventory across the two brands, thereby improving product availability.\\nW.W. Grainger does a good job of recognizing customer substitution.\\nWhen a customer calls or goes online to place an order and the product she requests is not available, the customer is immediately told the availability of all equivalent products that she may substitute.\\nMost customers ultimately buy a substitute product in this case.\\nW.W. Grainger exploits this substitution by managing safety inventory of all substitutable products jointly.\\nRecognition and exploitation of customer substitution allows W.W. Grainger to provide a high level of product availability with lower levels of safety inventory.\\nA good understanding of customer-driven substitution is important in the retail industry.\\nIt must be exploited when merchandising to ensure that substitute products are placed near each other, allowing a customer to buy one if the other is out of stock.\\nIn the online channel, substitution requires a retailer to present the availability of substitute products if the one the customer requests is out of stock.\\nThe supply chain is thus able to reduce the required level of safety inventory while providing a high level of product availability.\\nKey Point Recognition of customer-driven substitution and joint management of inventories across substitutable products allows a supply chain to reduce the required safety inventory while ensuring a high level of product availability.\\nThe demand uncertainties and the correlation of demand between the substitutable products influence the benefit to a retailer from exploiting substitution.\\nThe greater the demand uncertainty, the greater is the benefit of substitution.\\nThe less positive the correlation of demand between substitutable products, the greater is the benefit from exploiting substitution.\\nComponent Commonality In any supply chain, a significant amount of inventory is held in the form of components.\\nA single product such as a PC contains hundreds of components.\\nWhen a supply chain is producing a large variety of products, component inventories can easily become very large.\\nThe use of common components in a variety of products is an effective supply chain strategy to exploit aggregation and reduce component inventories.\\nDell sells thousands of PC configurations to customers.\\nAn extreme option for Dell is to design distinct components that are suited to the performance of a particular configuration.\\nDell would use different memory, hard drive, modem, and other components for each distinct finished product.\\nThe other option is to design products such that different combinations of the components result in different finished products.\\nWithout common components, the uncertainty of demand for any component is the same as the uncertainty of demand for the finished product in which it is used.\\nGiven the large number of components in each finished product, demand uncertainty will be high, resulting in high levels of safety inventory.\\nWhen products with common components are designed, the demand for each component is an aggregation of the demand for all the finished products of which the component is a part.\\nComponent demand is thus more predictable than the demand for any one finished product.\\nThis fact reduces the component inventories carried in the supply chain.\\nThis idea has been a key factor for success in the PC industry and has also started to play a big role in the auto industry.\\nWith increasing product variety, component commonality is a key to reducing supply chain inventories without hurting product availability.\\nWe illustrate the basic idea behind component commonality in Example 12-11.\\nEXAMPLE 12-11 Value of Component Commonality Assume that Dell is to manufacture 27 PCs with three distinct components: processor, memory, and hard drive.\\nUnder the disaggregate option, Dell designs specific components for each PC, resulting in 3 * 27 = 81 distinct components.\\nUnder the common-component option, Dell designs PCs such that three distinct processors, three distinct memory units, and three distinct hard drives can be combined to create 27 PCs.\\nEach component is thus used in nine PCs.\\nMonthly demand for each of the 27 PCs is independent and normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 3,000.\\nThe replenishment lead time for each component is one month.\\nDell is targeting a CSL of 95 percent for component inventory.\\nEvaluate the safety inventory requirements with and without the use of component commonality.\\nAlso evaluate the change in safety inventory requirements as the number of finished products of which a component is a part varies from one to nine.\\nAnalysis: We first evaluate the disaggregate option, in which components are specific to a PC.\\nFor each component, we have Standard deviation of monthly demand = 3,000 .\\nTotal safety inventory required = 81 * NORMSINV10.952 * 11 * 3,000 = 399,699 units .\\nSafety inventory per common component = NORMSINV10.952 * 11 * 19 * 3,000 = 14,804 units  .\\nTable 12-5 Marginal Benefit of Component Commonality  Number of Finished Products per Component  Safety Inventory  Marginal Reduction in Safety Inventory  1 399,699  2  282,630  117,069  3  230,766  51,864  4  199,849  30,917  5  178,751  21,098  6  163,176  15,575  7  151,072  12,104  8  141,315  9,757  9  133,233  8,082  Total Reduction in Safety Inventory 117,069 168,933 199,850 220,948 236,523 248,627 258,384 266,466  With component commonality, there are a total of nine distinct components.\\nThe total safety inventory across all nine components is thus Total safety inventory required = 9 * 14,804 = 133,236 Thus, having each component common to nine products results in a reduction in safety inventory for Dell from 399,699 to 133,236 units.\\nIn Table 12-5, we evaluate the marginal benefit in terms of reduction in safety inventory as a result of increasing component commonality.\\nStarting with the required safety inventory when each component is used in only one finished product, we evaluate the safety inventory as the number of products in which a component is used increases to nine.\\nObserve that component commonality decreases the required safety inventory for Dell.\\nThe marginal benefit of commonality, however, declines as a component is used in more and more finished products.\\nAs a component is used in more finished products, it needs to be more flexible.\\nAs a result, the cost of producing the component typically increases with increasing commonality.\\nGiven that the marginal benefit of component commonality decreases as we increase commonality, we need to trade off the increase in component cost and the decrease in safety inventory when deciding on the appropriate level of component commonality.\\nKey Point Component commonality decreases the safety inventory required.\\nThe marginal benefit, however, decreases with increasing commonality.\\nPostponement Postponement is the ability of a supply chain to delay product differentiation or customization until closer to the time the product is sold.\\nThe goal is to have common components in the supply chain for most of the push phase and move product differentiation as close to the pull phase of the supply chain as possible.\\nFor example, the final mixing of paint today is done at the retail store after the customer has selected the color she wants.\\nThus, paint variety is produced only when demand is known with certainty.\\nPostponement coupled with component commonality allows paint retailers to carry significantly lower safety inventories than in the past when mixing was done at the paint factory.\\nIn the past, the factory manager had to forecast paint demand by color  .\\nSupply Chain Flows Without Postponement Supply Chain Flows with Component Commonality and Postponement .\\nwhen planning production.\\nToday, a factory manager needs to forecast only aggregate paint demand because mixing has been postponed until after customer demand is known.\\nAs a result, each retail store primarily carries aggregate inventory in the form of base paint that is configured to the appropriate color based on customer demand.\\nAnother classic example of postponement is the production process at Benetton to make colored knit garments.\\nThe original process called for the thread to be dyed and then knitted and assembled into garments.\\nThe entire process required up to six months.\\nBecause the color of the final garment was fixed the moment the thread was dyed, demand for individual colors had to be forecast far in advance (up to six months).\\nBenetton developed a manufacturing technology that allowed it to dye knitted garments to the appropriate color.\\nNow greige thread (the term used for thread that has not yet been dyed) can be purchased, knitted, and assembled into garments before dyeing.\\nThe dyeing of the garments is done much closer to the selling season.\\nIn fact, part of the dyeing is done after the start of the selling season, when demand is known with great accuracy.\\nIn this case, Benetton has postponed the color customization of the knit garments.\\nWhen thread is purchased, only the aggregate demand across all colors needs to be forecast.\\nGiven that this decision is made far in advance, when forecasts are least likely to be accurate, there is great advantage to this aggregation.\\nAs Benetton moves closer to the selling season, the forecast uncertainty reduces.\\nAt the time Benetton dyes the knit garments, demand is known with a high degree of accuracy.\\nThus, postponement allows Benetton to exploit aggregation and significantly reduce the level of safety inventory carried.\\nSupply chain flows with and without postponement are illustrated in Figure 12-5.\\nWithout component commonality and postponement, product differentiation occurs early on in the supply chain, and most of the supply chain inventories are disaggregate.\\nPostponement allows the supply chain to delay product differentiation.\\nAs a result, most of the inventories in the supply chain are aggregate.\\nPostponement thus allows a supply chain to exploit aggregation to reduce safety inventories without hurting product availability.\\nWe illustrate the benefits of postponement in Example 12-12.\\nA more nuanced discussion of the value of postponement is given in Chapter 13.\\nEXAMPLE 12-12 Value of Postponement Consider a paint retailer who sells 100 different colors of paint.\\nAssume that weekly demand for each color is independent and is normally distributed with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10.\\nThe replenishment lead time from the paint factory is two weeks and the retailer aims for a CSL  0.95.\\nHow much safety stock will the retailer have to hold if paint is mixed at the factory and held in inventory at the retailer as individual colors?\\nHow does the safety stock requirement change if the retailer holds base paint (supplied by the paint factory) and mixes colors on demand?\\nAnalysis: We first evaluate the disaggregate option, in which the retailer holds safety inventory for each color sold.\\nFor each color we have .\\nTotal required safety inventory, ss = 100 * Fs-11CSL2 * 1L * sD = 100 * NORMSINV10.952 * 12 * 10 = 2,326 .\\nStandard deviation of weekly demand of base paint, sCD = 1100 * 10 = 100 .\\nss = Fs-110.952 * 1L * sDC = NORMSINV10.952 * 12 * 100 = 233 Observe that postponement reduces the required safety inventory at the paint retailer from 2,326 units to 233 units.\\nPostponement can be a powerful concept for the online channel.\\nWhen ordering over the Internet, customers are implicitly willing to wait a little for the order to arrive.\\nThis delay offers the supply chain an opportunity to reduce inventories by postponing product differentiation until after the customer order arrives.\\nIt is important that the manufacturing process be designed in a way that enables assembly to be completed quickly.\\nAll PC manufacturers are already postponing assembly for their online orders.\\nSeveral furniture and window manufacturers have also postponed some of the assembly processes for their orders.\\nIn this section, we describe the evaluation of safety inventories for both continuous and periodicreview replenishment policies.\\nWe highlight the fact that periodic review policies require more safety inventory than continuous review policies for the same level of product availability.\\nTo simplify the discussion, we focus on the CSL as the measure of product availability.\\nThe managerial implications are the same if we use fill rate; the analysis, however, is more cumbersome.\\nContinuous Review Policies .\\nGiven a desired CSL, our goal is to identify the required safety inventory ss and the ROP.\\nWe assume that demand is normally distributed, with the following inputs: D: Average demand per period sD: Standard deviation of demand per period L: Average lead time for replenishment  .\\nThe ROP represents the available inventory to meet demand during the lead time L. A stockout occurs if the demand during the lead time is larger than the ROP.\\nIf demand across periods is independent, demand during the lead time is normally distributed with the following: Mean demand during lead time, DL = D*L Standard deviation of demand during lead time, sL = 1LsD .\\nss = FS-11CSL2 * sL = NORMSINV1CSL2 * 2LsD, ROP = DL + ss A manager using a continuous review policy has to account only for the uncertainty of demand during the lead time.\\nThis is because the continuous monitoring of inventory allows the manager to adjust the timing of the replenishment order, depending on the demand experienced.\\nIf demand is very high, inventory reaches the ROP quickly, leading to a quick replenishment order.\\nIf demand is very low, inventory drops slowly to the ROP, leading to a delayed replenishment order.\\nThe manager, however, has no recourse during the lead time once a replenishment order has been placed.\\nThe available safety inventory thus must cover for the uncertainty of demand over this period.\\nTypically, in continuous review policies, the lot size ordered is kept fixed between replenishment cycles.\\nThe optimal lot size may be evaluated using the EOQ formula discussed in Chapter 10.\\nPeriodic Review Policies In periodic review policies, inventory levels are reviewed after a fixed period of time T and an order is placed such that the level of current inventory plus the replenishment lot size equals a prespecified level called the order-up-to level (OUL).\\nThe review interval is the time T between successive orders.\\nObserve that the size of each order may vary, depending on the demand experienced between successive orders and the resulting inventory at the time of ordering.\\nPeriodic review policies are simpler for retailers to implement because they do not require that the retailer have the capability of monitoring inventory continuously.\\nSuppliers may also prefer them because they result in replenishment orders placed at regular intervals.\\nLet us consider the store manager at Wal-Mart who is responsible for designing a replenishment policy for Lego building blocks.\\nHe wants to analyze the impact on safety inventory if he decides to use a periodic review policy.\\nDemand for Legos is normally distributed and independent from one week to the next.\\nWe assume the following inputs: D: Average demand per period sD: Standard deviation of demand per period L: Average lead time for replenishment T: Review interval CSL: Desired cycle service level To understand the safety inventory requirement, we track the sequence of events over time as the store manager places orders.\\nThe store manager places the first order at time 0 such that the lot size ordered and the inventory on hand sum to the order-up-to level, OUL.\\nOnce an order is placed, the replenishment lot arrives after the lead time L. The next review period is time T, when the store manager places the next order, which then arrives at time T  L. The OUL represents the inventory available to meet all demand that arises between periods 0 and T  L. The Wal-Mart store will experience a stockout if demand during the time interval between 0 and T  L exceeds the OUL.\\nThus, the store manager must identify an OUL such that the following is true: Probability1demand during L + T ... OUL2 = CSL  .\\nMean demand during T + L periods, DT+L = 1T + L2D Standard deviation of demand during T + L periods, sT+L = 1T + L sD The safety inventory in this case is the quantity in excess of DT+L carried by Wal-Mart over the time interval T  L. The OUL and the safety inventory ss are related as follows:  OUL = DT+L + ss  .\\nGiven the desired CSL, the safety inventory (ss) required is given by  ss = FS-11CSL2 * sT+L = NORMSINV1CSL2 * sT+L  .\\nThe average lot size equals the average demand during the review period T and is given as  Average lot size, Q = DT = D*T  .\\nIn Figure 12-6, we show the inventory profile for a periodic review policy with lead time L  4 and reorder interval T  7.\\nObserve that on day 7, the company places an order that determines available inventory until day 18 (as illustrated in the line from point 1 and point 2).\\nAs a result, the safety inventory must be sufficient to buffer demand variability over T  L  7  4  11 days.\\nWe illustrate the periodic review policy for Wal-Mart in Example 12-13.\\nEXAMPLE 12-13 Evaluation Safety Inventory for a Periodic Review Policy Weekly demand for Legos at a Wal-Mart store is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 boxes and a standard deviation of 500.\\nThe replenishment lead time is two weeks, and the store manager has decided to review inventory every four weeks.\\nAssuming a periodic-review replenishment policy, evaluate the safety inventory that the store should carry to provide a CSL of 90 percent.\\nEvaluate the OUL for such a policy.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have Average demand per period, D  2,500 Standard deviation of demand per period, sD = 500  OUL  Warehouse Inventory  T=7 L=4 Safety Inventory 0  DT T 1 DL L  L  5 10 15 Days  2 SS 20  25  Review Point 0  Review Point 1  Review Point 2  Review Point 3  .\\nAverage lead time for replenishment, L = 2 weeks Review interval, T  4 weeks .\\nMean demand during T + L periods, DT+L = 1T + L2D = 12 + 422,500 = 15,000 Standard deviation of demand during T + L periods, sT+L = 1T + L sD = 114 + 22 500 = 1,225 .\\nThe store manager thus orders the difference between 16,570 and current inventory every four weeks.\\nWe can now compare the safety inventory required when using continuous and periodic review policies.\\nWith a continuous review policy, the safety inventory is used to cover for demand uncertainty over the lead time L. With a periodic review policy, the safety inventory is used to cover for demand uncertainty over the lead time and the review interval L  T. Given that higher uncertainty must be accounted for, periodic review policies require a higher level of safety inventory.\\nThis argument can be confirmed by comparing the results in Examples 12-4 and 12-13.\\nFor a 90 percent CSL, the store manager requires a safety inventory of 906 boxes when using a continuous review and a safety inventory of 1,570 boxes when using a periodic review.\\nKey Point Periodic review replenishment policies require more safety inventory than continuous review policies for the same lead time and level of product availability.\\nOf course, periodic review policies are somewhat simpler to implement because they do not require continuous tracking of inventory.\\nGiven the broad use of bar codes and point-of-sale systems as well as the emergence of RFID technology, continuous tracking of all inventories is much more commonplace today than it was a decade ago.\\nIn some instances, companies partition their products based on their value.\\nHigh-value products are managed using continuous review policies, and low-value products are managed using periodic review policies.\\nThis makes sense if the cost of perpetual tracking of inventory is more than the savings in safety inventory that result from switching all products to a continuous review policy.\\nIn our discussion so far, we have assumed that each stage of the supply chain has a well-defined demand and supply distribution that it uses to set its safety inventory levels.\\nIn practice, this is not true for multiechelon supply chains.\\nConsider a simple multiechelon supply chain with a supplier feeding a retailer who sells to the final customer.\\nThe retailer needs to know demand as well as supply uncertainty to set safety inventory levels.\\nSupply uncertainty, however, is influenced by the level of safety  .\\ninventory the supplier chooses to carry.\\nIf a retailer order arrives when the supplier has enough inventory, the supply lead time is short.\\nIn contrast, if the retailer order arrives when the supplier is out of stock, the replenishment lead time for the retailer increases.\\nThus, if the supplier increases its level of safety inventory, the retailer can reduce the safety inventory it holds.\\nThis implies that the level of safety inventory at all stages in a multiechelon supply chain should be related.\\nAll inventory between a stage and the final customer is called the echelon inventory.\\nEchelon inventory at a retailer is just the inventory at the retailer or in the pipeline coming to the retailer.\\nEchelon inventory at a distributor, however, includes inventory at the distributor and all retailers served by the distributor.\\nIn a multiechelon setting, reorder points and order-up-to levels at any stage should be based on echelon inventory and not local inventory.\\nThus, a distributor should decide its safety inventory levels based on the level of safety inventory carried by all retailers supplied by it.\\nThe more safety inventory retailers carry, the less safety inventory the distributor needs to carry.\\nAs retailers decrease the level of safety inventory they carry, the distributor has to increase its safety inventory to ensure regular replenishment at the retailers.\\nIf all stages in a supply chain attempt to manage their echelon inventory, the issue of how the inventory is divided among various stages becomes important.\\nCarrying inventory upstream in a supply chain allows for more aggregation and thus reduces the amount of inventory required.\\nCarrying inventory upstream, however, increases the probability that the final customer will have to wait because product is not available at a stage close to him or her.\\nThus, in a multiechelon supply chain, a decision must be made with regard to the level of safety inventory carried at different stages.\\nIf inventory is expensive to hold and customers are willing to tolerate a delay, it is better to increase the amount of safety inventory carried upstream, far from the final customer, to exploit the benefits of aggregation.\\nIf inventory is inexpensive to hold and customers are time sensitive, it is better to carry more safety inventory downstream, closer to the final customer.\\nBesides the basics of formalizing inventory replenishment procedures for thousands of SKUs, the two most significant contributions of IT systems can be improved inventory visibility and better coordination in the supply chain.\\nAn excellent example of the benefits of improved inventory visibility is Nordstrom, a department store chain in the United States.\\nThe company was always very good at managing its inventories (IT systems played an important role here) but had historically separated its online inventories and its store inventories.\\nIn September 2009, the company started integrating store inventories on to its Web site.\\nCustomers are now able to access inventory no matter where it was available.\\nIf they prefer home delivery, Nordstrom can now use store inventory to serve them.\\nIf, however, they prefer to pick up the item themselves, Nordstrom allows them to reserve it for pickup.\\nThe increased inventory visibility allows Nordstrom to serve its online customers better while also drawing more traffic to stores.\\nIn 2010, Wal-Mart also added a similar feature called \"Pick Up Today\" that allows customers to place orders online and pick them up a few hours later at a retail store.\\nCustomers are alerted (typically through a text message) when the order is ready.\\nRedbox uses inventory visibility at each of its vending machines to guide customers to the closest kiosk that has the desired DVD in stock.\\nIn each example, the increased visibility provided by IT systems allows the firm to improve product availability to the customer without increasing inventories.\\nAnother area in which improved visibility could play a significant role is locating in-store or in-warehouse inventory.\\nIt is often the case that a store or warehouse has inventory available but in the wrong place.\\nThe net result is a loss in product availability despite carrying inventory.\\nGood RFID systems have the potential to address this issue.\\nWhile there has been limited success using RFID systems at the item level in stores (there has been some success with high-value apparel), there has been success in areas like warehousing of aircraft spare parts.\\nIT systems have also played a significant role in better integrating different stages of the supply chain.\\nA classic example is the continuous replenishment program (CRP) set up between  .\\nProcter and Gamble (P&G) and Wal-Mart that allowed P&G to replenish diaper inventory at Wal-Mart based on the visibility of available inventories and sales at Wal-Mart.\\nThis coordination allowed the two firms to improve service levels while reducing inventories.\\nOver time, the program evolved into collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10), which allows better coordination of planning and replenishment across multiple supply chain partners through improved visibility of inventories and sales.\\nWhile each of these programs uses IT as a foundation, it is important to acknowledge that success requires important organizational changes and leadership commitment as discussed in Chapter 10.\\nGood IT systems are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for success.\\nIt is important to recognize that the value of the IT system in each of the cases discussed above is tightly linked to the accuracy of the inventory information.\\nInaccurate inventory information leads to flawed decisions and could in the worst case create mistrust among supply chain partners attempting to coordinate the decisions and actions.\\nA study by DeHoratius and Raman (2008) found that about 65 percent of the inventory records checked for a retailer were inaccurate.\\nThat is, for 65 percent of the records checked, the inventory on hand did not match the inventory showing in the IT system.\\nWithout reasonably accurate inventory records, the value provided by an IT system will be limited.\\nAccount for the fact that supply chain demand is lumpy.\\nIn practice, a manufacturer or distributor does not order one unit at a time but instead often orders in a large lot.\\nThus, demand observed by different stages of the supply chain tends to be lumpy.\\nLumpiness adds to the variability of demand.\\nFor example, when using a continuous review policy, lumpiness may lead to inventory dropping far below the ROP before a replenishment order is placed.\\nOn average, inventory will drop below the ROP by half the average size of an order.\\nThe lumpiness can be accounted for in practice by raising the safety inventory suggested by the models discussed earlier by half the average size of an order.\\nAdjust inventory policies if demand is seasonal.\\nIn practice, demand is often seasonal, with the mean and the standard deviation of demand varying by the time of year.\\nThus, a given reorder point or order-up-to level may correspond to 10 days of demand during the low-demand season and only 2 days of demand during the peak demand season.\\nIf the lead time is one week, stockouts are certain to occur during the peak season.\\nIn the presence of seasonality, it is not appropriate to select an average demand and standard deviation over the year to evaluate fixed reorder points and order-up-to levels.\\nBoth the mean and the standard deviation of demand must be adjusted by the time of year to reflect changing demand.\\nCorresponding adjustments in the reorder points, order-up-to levels, and safety inventories must be made over the year.\\nAdjustments for changes in the mean demand over the year are generally more significant than adjustments for changes in variability.\\nUse simulation to test inventory policies.\\nGiven that demand is most likely not normally distributed and may be seasonal, it is a good idea to test and adjust inventory policies using a computer simulation before they are implemented.\\nThe simulation should use a demand pattern that truly reflects actual demand, including any lumpiness as well as seasonality.\\nThe inventory policies obtained using the models discussed in the chapter can then be tested and adjusted if needed to obtain the desired service levels.\\nSurprisingly powerful simulations can be built using Excel, as we discuss in Chapter 13.\\nIdentifying problems in a simulation can save a lot of time and money compared to facing these problems once the inventory policy is in place.\\nEven a simulation cannot identify all problems that may arise when using an inventory policy.\\nOnce an inventory policy has been selected and tested using simulation, it is often a good idea to start implementation with a pilot program of products that  .\\nare representative of the entire set of products in inventory.\\nBy starting with a pilot, many of the problems (both in the inventory policies themselves and in the process of applying the policies) can be solved.\\nGetting these problems solved before the policy is rolled out to all the products can save a lot of time and money.\\nMonitor service levels.\\nOnce an inventory policy has been implemented, it is important that its performance be tracked and monitored.\\nMonitoring is crucial because it allows a supply chain to identify when a policy is not working well and make adjustments before supply chain performance is affected significantly.\\nMonitoring requires not just tracking the inventory levels but also tracking any stockouts that may result.\\nHistorically, firms have not tracked stockouts very well, partly because they are difficult to track and partly because of the perception that stockouts affect the customer but not the firm itself.\\nStockouts can be difficult to measure in a situation such as a supermarket, where the customer simply does not buy the product when it is not on the shelf.\\nHowever, there are simple ways to estimate stockouts.\\nAt a supermarket, the fraction of time that a shelf does not contain a product may be used to estimate the fill rate.\\nStockouts are in fact easier to estimate online, where the number of clicks on an out-of-stock product can be measured.\\nGiven the fraction of clicks that turn into orders and the average size of an order, demand during a stockout can be estimated.\\nFocus on reducing safety inventories.\\nGiven that safety inventory is often a large fraction of the total inventory in a supply chain, the ability to reduce safety inventory without hurting product availability can significantly increase supply chain profitability.\\nThis is particularly important in the high-tech industry, where product life cycles are short.\\nIn this chapter, we discussed a variety of managerial levers that can help reduce safety inventories without hurting availability.\\nSupply chain managers must focus continuously on using these levers to reduce safety inventories.\\nUnderstand the role of safety inventory in a supply chain.\\nSafety inventory helps a supply chain provide customers with a high level of product availability in spite of supply and demand uncertainty.\\nIt is carried just in case demand exceeds the amount forecasted or supply arrives later than expected.\\nIdentify factors that influence the required level of safety inventory.\\nSafety inventory is influenced by demand uncertainty, replenishment lead times, lead time variability, and desired product availability.\\nAs any one of them increases, the required safety inventory also increases.\\nThe required safety inventory is also influenced by the inventory policy implemented.\\nContinuous review policies require less safety inventory than periodic review policies.\\nDescribe different measures of product availability.\\nThe three basic measures of product availability are product fill rate, order fill rate, and cycle service level.\\nProduct fill rate is the fraction of demand for a product that is successfully filled.\\nOrder fill rate is the fraction of orders that are completely filled.\\nCycle service level is the fraction of replenishment cycles in which no stockouts occur.\\nUtilize managerial levers available to lower safety inventory and improve product availability.\\nThe required level of safety inventory may be reduced and product availability may be improved if a supply chain can reduce demand uncertainty, replenishment lead times, and the variability of lead times.\\nA switch from periodic monitoring to continuous monitoring can also help reduce inventories.\\nAnother key managerial lever to reduce the required safety inventories is to exploit aggregation.\\nThis may be achieved by physically aggregating inventories, virtually aggregating inventories using information centralization, specializing inventories based on demand volume, exploiting substitution, using component commonality, and postponing product differentiation.\\n Identify the factors affecting the optimal level of product availability and evaluate the optimal cycle service level.\\nUse managerial levers that improve supply chain profitability through optimal service levels.\\nUnderstand conditions under which postponement is valuable in a supply chain.\\nAllocate limited supply capacity among multiple products to maximize expected profits.\\nIn this chapter, we explore the process of determining the optimal level of product availability to be offered to customers.\\nThe chapter examines the components that go into the calculation of the optimal service level and the various ways that this calculation can be performed.\\nWe discuss and demonstrate how different managerial levers can be used to improve supply chain profitability by increasing the level of product availability while reducing inventories.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, U.S. inventories shot up by $6.2 billion because of the rapid decline in demand that hit retailers and manufacturers.\\nFor some manufacturers, the situation was exaggerated because of the excess inventory of raw materials, such as steel and plastics, they had built up anticipating price increases.\\nRetailers were also hit hard with some, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, slashing prices by 70 percent during the holiday season to spur demand.\\nThe excess inventories and the drop in demand led to several retailers, such as Steve and Barry and Circuit 358  .\\nCity, declaring bankruptcy during this period.\\nIn contrast, Nintendo missed out on an estimated $1.3 billion in sales during the 2007 holiday season because of a failure to meet soaring global demand of its Wii video game console.\\nThese examples make clear that having too high or too low a level of product availability has a significant impact on supply chain profits.\\nWhether the optimal level of availability is high or low depends on where a particular company believes it can maximize profits.\\nNordstrom has focused on providing a high level of product availability and has used its reputation for responsiveness to become a successful department store chain.\\nHowever, prices at Nordstrom are higher than at a discount store, where the level of product availability is lower.\\nPower plants ensure that they (almost) never run out of fuel because a shutdown is extremely expensive, resulting in several days of lost production.\\nSome power plants try to maintain several months of fuel supply to avoid any probability of running out.\\nIn contrast, most supermarkets carry only a few days\\' supply of product, and out-of-stock situations do occur with some frequency.\\nThe Internet allows a customer to easily shop at an alternative store if the first choice is out of stock.\\nThis competitive environment puts pressure on online retailers to increase their level of availability.\\nSimultaneously, significant price competition has lowered prices online.\\nWeb retailers with excess inventory find it difficult to be profitable.\\nProviding the optimal level of product availability is thus a key to success online.\\nIn the examples described earlier, firms provide different levels of product availability.\\nEvery supply chain manager must use factors that influence the optimal level of product availability to target that optimal level and identify managerial levers that increase supply chain surplus.\\nNext, we identify factors that affect the optimal level of product availability.\\nTo understand the factors that influence the optimal level of product availability, consider L.L.Bean, a large mail-order company that sells apparel.\\nOne of the products L.L.Bean sells is ski jackets.\\nThe selling season for ski jackets is from November to February.\\nThe buyer at L.L.Bean currently purchases the entire season\\'s supply of ski jackets from the manufacturer before the start of the selling season.\\nProviding a high level of product availability requires the purchase of a large number of jackets.\\nAlthough a high level of product availability is likely to satisfy all demand that arises, it is also likely to result in a large number of unsold jackets at the end of the season, with L.L.Bean losing money on unsold jackets.\\nIn contrast, a low level of product availability is likely to result in few unsold jackets.\\nHowever, it is quite likely that L.L.Bean will have to turn away customers willing to buy jackets because they are sold out.\\nIn this scenario, L.L.Bean loses potential profit by losing customers.\\nThe buyer at L.L.Bean must balance the loss from having too many unsold jackets (in case the number of jackets ordered is more than demand) and the lost profit from turning away customers (in case the number of jackets ordered is less than demand) when deciding the level of product availability.\\nThe cost of overstocking is denoted by Co and is the loss incurred by a firm for each unsold unit at the end of the selling season.\\nThe cost of understocking is denoted by Cu and is the margin lost by a firm for each lost sale because there is no inventory on hand.\\nThe cost of understocking should include the margin lost from current as well as future sales if the customer does not return.\\nIn summary, the two key factors that influence the optimal level of product availability are ?Cost of overstocking the product ?Cost of understocking the product We illustrate and develop this relationship in the context of a buying decision at L.L.Bean.\\nThe first point to observe is that deciding on an optimal level of product availability makes sense only in the context of demand uncertainty.\\nTraditionally, many firms have forecast a consensus  .\\nTable 13-1 Demand Distribution for Parkas at L.L.Bean  Demand Di  Cumulative Probability of  Probability of Demand  (in hundreds) Probability pi Demand Being Di or Less (Pi) Being Greater than D(1Pi)  4 0.01 5 0.02 6

0.29 0.18 0.08 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.00  estimate of demand without any measure of uncertainty.\\nIn this setting, firms do not make a decision regarding the level of availability; they simply order the consensus forecast.\\nOver the past decade, firms have developed a better appreciation for uncertainty and have started developing forecasts that include a measure of uncertainty.\\nIncorporating uncertainty and deciding on the optimal level of product availability can increase profits relative to using a consensus forecast.\\nL.L.Bean has a buying committee that decides on the quantity of each product to be ordered.\\nBased on demand over the past few years, the buyers have estimated the demand distribution for a women\\'s red ski parka to be as shown in Table 13-1.\\nThis is a deviation from its traditional practice of using the average historical demand as the consensus forecast.\\nTo simplify the discussion, we assume that all demand is in hundreds of parkas.\\nThe manufacturer also requires that L.L.Bean place orders in multiples of 100.\\nIn Table 13-1, pi is the probability that demand equals Di, and Pi is the probability that demand is less than or equal to Di.\\nFrom Table 13-1, we evaluate the expected demand of Parkas as Expected demand = a Dipi = 1,026 Under the old policy of ordering the expected value, the buyers would have ordered 1,000 parkas.\\nHowever, demand is uncertain and Table 13-1 shows that there is a 51 percent probability that demand will be 1,000 or less.\\nThus, a policy of ordering a thousand parkas results in a cycle service level of 51 percent at L.L.Bean.\\nThe buying committee must decide on an order size and cycle service level that maximizes the profits from the sale of parkas at L.L.Bean.\\nThe loss that L.L.Bean incurs from an unsold parka and the profit that L.L.Bean makes on each parka it sells influences the buying decision.\\nEach parka costs L.L.Bean c  $45 and is priced in the catalog at p  $100.\\nAny unsold parkas at the end of the season are sold at the outlet store for $50.\\nHolding the parka in inventory and transporting it to the outlet store costs L.L.Bean $10.\\nThus, L.L.Bean recovers a salvage value of s  $40 for each parka that is unsold at the end of the season.\\nL.L.Bean makes a profit of p  c  $55 on each parka it sells and incurs a loss of c  s  $5 on each unsold parka that is sold at the outlet store.\\nThe expected profit from ordering 1,000 parkas is given as 10 17 Expected profit = a [Di1p - c2 - 11,000 - Di21c - s2]pi + a 1,0001p - c2pi i = 4 i = 11 = [400 * 55 - 600 * 5] * 0.01 + [500 * 55 - 500 * 5] * 0.02 + [600 * 55 - 400 * 5] * 0.04 + [700 * 55 - 300 * 5] * 0.08 + [800 * 55 - 200 * 5] * 0.09 + [900 * 55  100 * 5] * 0.11 + [1000 * 55 - 0 * 5] *

committee must determine the impact of buying the extra 100 units.\\nIf 1,100 parkas are ordered, the extra 100 are sold (for a profit of $5,500) if demand is 1,100 or higher.\\nOtherwise, the extra 100 units are sent to the outlet store at a loss of $500.\\nFrom Table 13-1, we see that there is a probability of 0.49 that demand is 1,100 or higher and a 0.51 probability that demand is 1,000 or less.\\nThus, we deduce the following: Expected profit from the extra 100 parkas = 5,500 * Prob(demand ?1,100) - 500 * Prob(demand 6 1,100) = $5,500 * 0.49 - $500 * 0.51 = $2,440 The total expected profit from ordering 1,100 parkas is thus $52,340, which is almost 5 percent higher than the expected profit from ordering 1,000 parkas.\\nUsing the same approach, we evaluate the marginal contribution of each additional 100 parkas as in Table 13-2.\\nNote that the expected marginal contribution is positive up to 1,300 parkas, but it is negative from that point on.\\nThus, the optimal order size is 1,300 parkas.\\nFrom Table 13-2, we have Expected profit from ordering 1,300 parkas = $49,900 + $2,440 + $1,240 + $580 = $54,160 This is more than an 8 percent increase in profitability relative to the policy of ordering the expected value of 1,000 parkas.\\nA plot of total expected profits versus the order quantity is shown in Figure 13-1.\\nThe optimal order quantity maximizes the expected profit.\\nFor L.L.Bean, the optimal order quantity is 1,300 parkas, which provides a CSL of 92 percent.\\nObserve that with a CSL of 0.92, L.L.Bean has a fill rate that is much higher.\\nIf demand is 1,300 or less, L.L.Bean achieves a fill  Table 13-2 Expected Marginal Contribution of Each Additional 100 Parkas  Additional Hundreds  Expected Marginal Benefit  Expected Marginal Cost

of the demand (D  1,300) is not satisfied.\\nIn this case, a fill rate of 1,300>D is achieved.\\nOverall, the fill rate achieved at L.L.Bean if 1,300 parkas are ordered is given by fr = 1 * Prob

L.L.Bean satisfies, on average, 99 percent of its demand from parkas in inventory.\\nIn the L.L.Bean example, we have a cost of overstocking of Co  c  s  $5 and a cost of understocking of Cu  p  c  $55.\\nAs these costs change, the optimal level of product availability also changes.\\nIn the next section, we develop the relationship between the desired CSL and the cost of overstocking and understocking for seasonal items.\\nOptimal Cycle Service Level for Seasonal Items with a Single Order in a Season In this section, we focus attention on seasonal products such as ski jackets, for which all leftover items must be disposed of at the end of the season.\\nThe assumption is that the leftover items from the previous season are not used to satisfy demand for the current season.\\nAssume a retail price per unit of p, a cost of c, and a salvage value of s. We consider the following inputs: Co: Cost of overstocking by one unit, Co  c  s Cu: Cost of understocking by one unit, Cu  p  c CSL*: Optimal cycle service level O*: Corresponding optimal order size CSL* is the probability that demand during the season will be at or below O*.\\nAt the optimal cycle service level CSL*, the marginal contribution of purchasing an additional unit is zero.\\nIf the order quantity is raised from O* to O*  1, the additional unit sells if demand is larger than O*.\\nThis occurs with probability 1  CSL* and results in a contribution of p  c. We thus have Expected benefit of purchasing extra unit = (1 - CSL*)(p - c) The additional unit remains unsold if demand is at or below O*.\\nThis occurs with probability CSL* and results in a cost of c  s. We thus have Expected cost of purchasing extra unit = CSL*(c - s)  .\\nThus, the expected marginal contribution of raising the order size from O* to O* + 1 is given by (1 - CSL*)(p - c) - CSL*(c - s)  Because the expected marginal contribution must be 0 at the optimal cycle service level, we have  CSL* = Prob1Demand ... O*2 =  p-c p-s  =  Cu Cu + Co  =  1 1 + 1Co>Cu2  .\\nA more rigorous derivation of the previously mentioned formula is provided in Appendix 13A.\\nThe optimal CSL* has also been referred to as the critical fractile.\\nThe resulting optimal order quantity maximizes the firm\\'s profit.\\nIf demand during the season is normally distributed, with a mean of  and a standard deviation of , the optimal order quantity is given by  O* = F-1(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s)  .\\nWhen demand is normally distributed, with a mean of  and a standard deviation of , the expected profit from ordering O units is given by  O-m  O-m  Expected profit = 1p - s2mFs a s b - 1p - s2sfs a s b  - O1c - s2F1O, m, s2 + O1p - c2[1 - F1O, m, s2]  The derivation of this formula is provided in Appendix 13B and Appendix 13C.\\nHere FS is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and fS is the standard normal density function discussed in Appendix 12A of Chapter 12.\\nThe expected profit from ordering O units is evaluated in Excel using Equations 12.21, 12.24, and 12.25 as follows:  Expected profits = 1p - s2mNORMDIST[1O - m2>s, 0, 1, 1] - 1p - s2sNORMDIST[1O - m2>s, 0, 1, 0] - O1c - s2NORMDIST1O, m, s, 12 + O1p - c2[1 - NORMDIST1O, m, s, 12]  .\\nEXAMPLE 13-1 Evaluating the Optimal Service Level for Seasonal Items The manager at Sportmart, a sporting goods store, has to decide on the number of skis to purchase for the winter season.\\nBased on past demand data and weather forecasts for the year, management has forecast demand to be normally distributed, with a mean of m = 350 and a standard deviation of s = 100.\\nEach pair of skis costs c  $100 and retails for p  $250.\\nAny unsold skis at the end of the season are disposed of for $85.\\nAssume that it costs $5 to hold a pair of skis in inventory for the season.\\nHow many skis should the manager order to maximize expected profits?\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have  Salvage value = s = $85 - $5 = $80 Cost of understocking = Cu = p - c = $250 - $100 = $150 Cost of overstocking = Co = c - s = $100 - $80 = $20 .\\nCSL*  =  Prob1Demand  ...  O*2  =  Cu Cu + Co  =  150 150 + 20  =  0.88  .\\nO* = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.88, 350, 100) = 468  Thus, it is optimal for the manager at Sportmart to order 468 pairs of skis even though the expected number of sales is 350.\\nIn this case, because the cost of understocking is much higher than the cost of overstocking, management is better off ordering more than the expected value to cover for the uncertainty of demand.\\nExpected profits = 1p - s2mNORMDIST C1O * - m2>s, 0, 1, 1)D - 1p - s2sNORMDIST[1O * - m2>s, 0, 1, 0)] - O *1c - s2NORMDIST1O*, m, s, 12 + O *1p - c2[1 - NORMDIST1O*, m, s, 12] = 59,500 NORMDIST11.18, 0, 1, 12 - 17,000 NORMDIST11.18, 0, 1, 02 - 9,360 NORMDIST1468, 350, 100, 12 + 70,200 [1 - NORMDIST1468, 350, 100, 12] = $49,146  The expected profit from ordering 350 pairs of skis can be evaluated as $45,718.\\nThus, ordering 468 pairs results in an expected profit that is almost 8 percent higher than the profit obtained from ordering the expected value of 350 pairs.\\nWhen O units are ordered, a firm is left with either too much or too little inventory, depending on demand.\\nWhen demand is normally distributed, with expected value  and standard deviation , the expected quantity overstocked at the end of the season is given by  O-m  O-m  Expected overstock = 1O - m2FS a s b + sfS a s b  The derivation of this formula is provided in Appendix 13D.\\nThe formula can be evaluated using Excel as follows:  Expected overstock = 1O - m2NORMDIST[1O - m2>s, 0, 1, 1] + sNORMDIST[1O - m2>s, 0, 1, 02]  .\\nO-m  O-m  Expected understock = 1m - O2 c 1 - FS a s b d + sfS a s b  The derivation of this formula is provided in Appendix 13E.\\nThe formula can be evaluated using Excel as follows:  Expected understock = 1m - O2[1 - NORMDIST[1O - m2>s, 0, 1, 1]]  + sNORMDIST[1O - m2/s, 0, 1, 0]  .\\nEXAMPLE 13-2 Evaluating Expected Overstock and Understock Demand for skis at Sportmart is normally distributed with a mean of   350 and a standard deviation of   100.\\nThe manager has decided to order 450 pairs of skis for the upcoming season.\\nEvaluate the expected overstock and understock as a result of this policy.\\nExpected overstock = (O - m)NORMDIST[(O - m)>s, 0, 1, 1] + sNORMDIST[(O - m)>s, 0, 1, 0] = (450 - 350)NORMDIST[(450 - 350)>100, 0, 1, 1] + 100 NORMDIST[(450 - 350)>100, 0, 1, 0] = 108 .\\nExpected understock = (m - O)[1 - NORMDIST[(O - m)>s, 0, 1, 1)] + sNORMDIST[(O - m)>s, 0, 1, 0)] = (350 - 450)[1 - NORMDIST(450 - 350)>100, 0, 1, 1)] + 100 NORMDIST[(450 - 350)>100, 0, 1, 0] = 8 Thus, the policy of ordering 450 pairs results in an expected understock of 8 pairs.\\nNote that the expected understock and overstock are positive in virtually every case.\\nThis result may seem counterintuitive initially, but it makes sense because the values used to calculate an expected understock or overstock are always greater than or equal to zero.\\nFor example, if demand is 500 and 450 jackets are in inventory, there is an understock of 50 and an overstock of 0 (not -50).\\nThis guarantees that the expected value of each will be greater than or equal to zero.\\nONE-TIME ORDERS IN THE PRESENCE OF QUANTITY DISCOUNTS In this section, we consider a buyer who has to make a single order when the seller offers a price discount based on the quantity purchased.\\nSuch a situation may arise in the context of seasonal items such as apparel, for which the manufacturer offers a lower price per unit if order quantities exceed a given threshold.\\nSuch decisions also arise at the end of the life cycle for a product or spare parts.\\nFuture demand for the product or spare parts is uncertain, and the buyer has a single opportunity to order.\\nThe buyer must account for the discount when selecting the order size.\\nConsider a retailer of spare parts who has one last chance to order parts before the manufacturer stops production.\\nThe part has a retail price per unit of p, a cost to the retailer (without discount) of c, and a salvage value of s. The manufacturer has offered a discounted price of cd if the retailer orders at least K units.\\nThe retailer can make its order size decision using the following steps:  .\\nUsing Co  cd - s and Cu  p  cd, evaluate the optimal cycle service level CSLd* and  order  size  O  * d  with  a  discount  using  Equations  .\\nOrder O* units if the profit in step 1 is higher.\\nIf the profit in step 2 is higher, order Od* units  if  Od*  ?\\nK or K  units if  O  * d  6  K.  We illustrate the procedure in Example 13-3.\\nEXAMPLE 13-3 Evaluating Service Level with Quantity Discounts  SparesRUs, an auto parts retailer, must decide on the order size for a 20-year-old model of brakes.\\nThe manufacturer plans to discontinue production of these brakes after this last production run.\\nSparesRUs has forecast remaining demand for the brakes to be normally distributed, with a mean of 150 and a standard deviation of 40.\\nThe brakes have a retail price of $200.\\nAny unsold brakes are useless and have no salvage value.\\nThe manufacturer plans to sell each brake for $50 if the order is for less than 200 brakes and $45 if the order is for at least 200 brakes.\\nHow many brakes should SparesRUs order?\\nAnalysis: In step 1, we calculate the optimal order quantity at the regular price c  $50:  Cost of understocking = Cu = p - c = $200 - $50 = $150 Cost of overstocking = Co = c - s = $50 - $0 = $50 .\\nCSL*  =  Prob1Demand  ...  O*2  =  Cu Cu + Co  =  150 150 + 50  =  0.75  .\\nO* = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.75, 150, 40) = 177  .\\nExpected profit from ordering 177 units = $19,958  .\\nIn step 2, we consider the discount price cd  $45 and obtain  Cost of understocking = Cu = p - cd = $200 - $45 = $155 Cost of overstocking = Co = cd - s = $45 - $0 = $45  .\\nCSLd* = Prob1Demand ...

CSL)Cu  In this case, the optimal cycle service level is obtained by equating the additional cost and benefit to be  CSL* = 1 - c HQ d DCu  .\\nGiven the optimal cycle service level, the required safety inventory can be evaluated using Equation 12.9 if demand is normally distributed.\\nEXAMPLE 13-4 Imputing Cost of Stockout from Inventory Policy Weekly demand for detergent at Wal-Mart is normally distributed, with a mean of   100 gallons and a standard deviation of   20.\\nThe replenishment lead time is L  2 weeks.\\nThe store manager at Wal-Mart orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons.\\nEach gallon of detergent costs $3.\\nThe holding cost Wal-Mart incurs is 20 percent.\\nIf all unfilled demand is backlogged and carried over to the next cycle, evaluate the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have  .\\nLot size, Q = 400 gallons Reorder point, ROP = 300 gallons Average demand per year, D = 100 * 52 = 5,200 Standard deviation of demand per week, sD = 20 Unit cost, C = $3 Holding cost as a fraction of product cost per year, h = 0.2 Cost of holding one unit for one year, H = hC = $0.6 Lead time, L = 2 weeks  We thus have  Mean demand over lead time, DL = 200 gallons Standard deviation of demand over lead time, sL = sD 1L = 20 12 = 28.3 Because demand is normally distributed, we can use Equations 12.4 and 12.21 to evaluate the CSL under the current inventory policy: CSL = F(ROP, DL, sL) = NORMDIST(300, 200, 28.3, 1) = 0.9998 .\\nCu  =  11  HQ - CSL2D  =  0.6 * 400 0.0002 * 5,200  =  $230.8 per gallon  The implication here is that if each shortage of a gallon of detergent costs Wal-Mart $230.8, the current CSL of 0.9998 is optimal.\\nIn this particular example, one can claim that the store manager is carrying too much inventory because the cost of stocking out of detergent is unlikely to be $230.8 per gallon.\\nA manager can use the previous analysis to decide if the imputed cost of stocking out, and thus the inventory policy, is reasonable.\\nDEMAND DURING STOCKOUT IS LOST When unfilled demand during the stockout period is lost, the optimal cycle service level CSL* is given as  CSL*  =  1  -  HQ HQ + DCu  (13.7)  .\\nEXAMPLE 13-5 Evaluating Optimal Service Level When Unmet Demand Is Lost Consider the situation in Example 13-4 but make the assumption that all demand during a stockout is lost.\\nAssume that the cost of losing one unit of demand is $2.\\nEvaluate the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Wal-Mart should target.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have Lot size, Q = 400 gallons Average demand per year, D = 100 * 52 = 5,200 Cost of holding one unit for one year, H = $0.6 Cost of understocking, Cu = $2 Using Equation 13.7, the optimal cycle service level is given as  CSL*  =  1  -  HQ HQ + DCu  =  1  -  0.6  *  0.6 * 400 +  400 2*  5,200  =  0.98  The store manager at Wal-Mart should target a cycle service level of 98 percent.\\nIncreasing the salvage value of each unit increases profitability (as well as the optimal cycle service level).\\nDecreasing the margin lost from a stockout increases profitability (by allowing a lower optimal cycle service level).\\nStrategies to increase the salvage value include selling to outlet stores so that leftover units are not merely discarded.\\nSome companies, such as Sport Obermeyer, which sells winter wear in the United States, sell the surplus in South America, where the winter corresponds to the North American summer.\\nThe increased salvage value of the surplus allows Sport Obermeyer to provide a higher level of product availability in the United States and increase its profits.\\nThe growth of online liquidators such as Overstock.com helps retailers by increasing their salvage value for overstocked products.\\nIncreasing the salvage value of leftover units allows a firm to grow profits by providing a higher level of product availability because the cost of excess inventory has been reduced.\\nStrategies to decrease the margin lost in a stockout include arranging for backup sourcing (which may be more expensive) so customers are not lost forever.\\nThe practice of purchasing product from a competitor on the open market to satisfy customer demand is observed and justified by the earlier reasoning.\\nIn the MRO supply industry, McMaster-Carr and W.W. Grainger, two major competitors, are also large customers for each other.\\nThe cost of understocking can also be decreased by providing the customer with a substitute product.\\nDecreasing the cost of understocking allows a firm to increase profits by providing  CSL* 1  .\\na lower level of product availability (because there are alternatives available to serve the customer), thus decreasing the amount of excess inventory at the end of the season.\\nThe optimal cycle service level as a function of the ratio of the cost of overstocking and the cost of understocking is shown in Figure 13-2.\\nObserve that as this ratio gets smaller, the optimal level of product availability increases.\\nThis fact explains the difference in the level of product availability between a high-end store such as Nordstrom and a discount store.\\nNordstrom has higher margins and thus a higher cost of understocking.\\nIt should thus provide a higher level of product availability than a discount store with lower margins and, as a result, a lower cost of stocking out.\\nAnother significant managerial lever to improve supply chain profitability is the reduction of demand uncertainty.\\nWith reduced demand uncertainty, a supply chain manager can better match supply and demand by reducing both overstocking and understocking.\\nA manager can reduce demand uncertainty via the following means: 1.\\nImproved forecasting: Use better market intelligence and collaboration to reduce demand uncertainty.\\nQuick response: Reduce replenishment lead time so that multiple orders may be placed in the selling season.\\nPostponement: In a multiproduct setting, postpone product differentiation until closer to the point of sale.\\nTailored sourcing: Use a low lead time, but perhaps an expensive supplier as a backup for a low-cost but perhaps long lead time supplier.\\nNext we study the impact of each of these on supply chain performance.\\nImproving Forecasts: Impact on Profits and Inventories Companies have tried to better understand their customers and coordinate actions within the supply chain to improve forecast accuracy.\\nThe use of demand planning information systems has also helped in this regard.\\nWe show that improved forecast accuracy can help a firm significantly increase its profitability while decreasing the excess inventory overstocked as well as the sales lost because of understocking.\\nWe illustrate the impact of improving forecast accuracy in Example 13-6.  .\\nEXAMPLE 13-6 Impact of Improved Forecasts Consider a buyer at Bloomingdale\\'s who is responsible for purchasing dinnerware with Christmas patterns.\\nThe dinnerware sells only during the Christmas season, and the buyer places an order for delivery in early November.\\nEach dinnerware set costs c  $100 and sells for a retail price of p  $250.\\nAny sets unsold by Christmas are heavily discounted in the postChristmas sales and are sold for a salvage value of s  $80.\\nThe buyer has estimated that demand is normally distributed, with a mean of   350.\\nHistorically, forecast errors have had a standard deviation of   150.\\nThe buyer has decided to conduct additional market research to get a better forecast.\\nEvaluate the impact of improved forecast accuracy on profitability and inventories as the buyer reduces  from 150 to 0 in increments of 30.\\nAnalysis: In this case, we have Cost of understocking  Cu  p  c  $250  $100  $150 Cost of overstocking  Co  c  s  $100  $80  $20 .\\nCSL* = Prob1Demand ... O*2 ?\\n150 150 + 20  =  0.88  .\\nKey Point An increase in forecast accuracy decreases both the overstocked and understocked quantity and increases a firm\\'s profits.\\nExample 13-6 illustrates that as a firm improves its forecast accuracy, expected quantity overstocked and understocked declines and expected profit increases.\\nThis relationship is shown in Figure 13-3.\\nTable 13-3 Expected Profit and Order Size at Bloomingdale\\'s  Standard Deviation of Forecast Error  Optimal Order Size O*  Expected Overstock  Expected Understock  150  526  186.7  8.6  120  491  149.3  6.9  90  456

of Forecast Error .\\nQuick Response: Impact on Profits and Inventories Quick response is the set of actions a supply chain takes to reduce the replenishment lead time.\\nSupply chain managers are able to improve their forecast accuracy as lead times decrease, which allows them to better match supply with demand and increase supply chain profitability.\\nWe have discussed the benefits of lead time reduction for regularly stocked items such as detergent in Chapter 12 (see Example 12-6).\\nWe now focus on the benefits of lead time reduction for seasonal items.\\nTo illustrate the issues, consider the example of Saks Fifth Avenue, a high-end department store, purchasing cashmere shawls from India and Nepal.\\nThe selling season for cashmere shawls is about 14 weeks.\\nHistorically, replenishment lead times have been on the order of 25 to 30 weeks.\\nWith a 30-week lead time, the buyer at Saks must order all the store expects to sell well before the start of the sales season.\\nIt is difficult for a buyer to make an accurate forecast of demand this far in advance.\\nThis results in high-demand uncertainty, leading the buyer to order either too many or too few shawls each year.\\nTypically, buyers are able to make accurate forecasts once they have observed sales for the first week or two in the season.\\nIf lead times can be shortened to facilitate the use of actual sales when placing part of the seasonal order, there can be significant benefits for the supply chain.\\nConsider the situation in which manufacturers are able to reduce replenishment lead time to six weeks.\\nThis reduction allows the buyer at Saks to break up the entire season\\'s purchase into two orders.\\nThe first order is placed six weeks before the start of the sales season.\\nThe buyer orders what the store expects to sell over the first seven weeks of the season.\\nThe first order has to be placed without observing any sales.\\nOnce the season starts, the buyer observes sales for the first week and places a second order after the first week.\\nWhen placing the second order, the buyer can use sales information from the first week of the season.\\nThe improved accuracy of the buyer\\'s predictions allows Saks to use the second order to better match supply and demand, resulting in higher profits.\\nThe buyer at Saks must decide on the quantity of cashmere shawls to order from India and Nepal for the upcoming winter season.\\nThe unit cost of each shawl is $40, and the shawl retails for $150.\\nA discount store purchases any leftover shawls at the end of the season for $30 each.\\nAfter the sales season of 14 weeks, any leftover shawls are sold to the discount store.\\nBefore the start of the sales season, the buyer forecasts weekly demand to be normally distributed, with a mean of D  20 and a standard deviation of D  15.\\nWe compare the impact of the following two ordering policies: 1.\\nSupply lead time is more than 15 weeks.\\nAs a result, a single order must be placed at the beginning of the season to cover the entire season\\'s demand.\\nSupply lead time is reduced to six weeks.\\nAs a result, two orders are placed for the season, one to be delivered at the beginning of the season and the other to be placed at the end of week 1 and delivered at the beginning of week 8.\\nFor policy 2, we assume that once the buyer sees sales for the first week, she is able to forecast demand for the first seven-week period accurately (this approximation allows us to quantify the benefits of the second order).\\nShe is still not able to predict sales for the second seven-week period.\\nIn terms of her forecasting ability for the second seven-week period, we consider two scenarios--one in which the buyer\\'s forecast accuracy does not improve for the second order (i.e., standard deviation of forecast demand stays at 15), and another in which it improves and the buyer is able to reduce the standard deviation of the forecast to 3 instead of 15.\\nWe also assume demand is independent across weeks.\\nWe first start with buyers placing a single order for the season.\\nGiven that the season lasts 14 weeks and demand is independent across weeks, we obtain the following (using Equation 12.1):  Expected demand of shawls in the season = m = 14D = 14 * 20 = 280 Standard deviation of seasonal demand, s = 114sD = 114 * 15 = 56.1  .\\nCSL*  =  p p  -  c s  =  150 150  -  40 30  =  0.92  .\\nO* = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.92, 280, 56.1) = 358  For an order of 358 shawls, we obtain  .\\nGiven that the cost of overstocking is $10 per shawl and the cost of understocking is $110 per shawl, we obtain  Expected cost of overstocking = 79.8 * $10 = $798 Expected cost of understocking = 2.14 * $110 = $235  If there were no demand uncertainty, demand over the season would be 280 shawls with a profit of 280 ?$110  $30,800.\\nObserve that expected profit is reduced by $30,800  $29,767  $1,033  $798  $235 because of uncertainty.\\nThus, uncertainty reduces the expected profit because of overstocking and understocking.\\nFrom the above analysis, it also follows that the reduction of uncertainty as a result of shortening lead times will increase profits by at most $1,033 in the season.\\nWe now describe a procedure that can be used to estimate the benefit of placing two orders in a season.\\nWe assume that the first order aims to cover demand for the first seven weeks and the second order for the last seven weeks.\\nGiven that the buyer will see the first week of demand before placing the second order, we have assumed that she will accurately be able to predict sales in the first seven-week period.\\nThus, her second order can take into account any leftover inventory from the first order.\\nFirst consider that no improvement in forecast accuracy occurs after observing the first period demand (standard deviation of weekly demand remains 15).\\nFor each seven-week period, we obtain the following: Expected demand of shawls in seven weeks = m7 = 7 * 20 = 140 Standard deviation of demand over seven weeks = s7 = 17 * 15 = 39.7 .\\nO1 = NORMINV(CSL*, m7, s7) = NORMINV(0.92, 140, 39.7) = 195 For an order of 195 shawls, we obtain .\\nRecall that the buyer can accurately predict sales over the first seven-week period when she places the second order at the end of week 1.\\nThus, any overstock resulting from the first order will be used to adjust the size of the second order.\\nGiven that the desired starting inventory for the second seven-week period is 195 shawls and the expected overstock at the end of the first seven-week period is 56.4 shawls, the second order will be only 195  56.4  138.6 shawls on average.\\nGiven that all overstock from the first seven-week period is used to lower the order size for the second seven-week period, there is no overstock cost from the first order and an expected overstock at the end of the season of 56.4 shawls (this is the expected overstock when starting the seven-week period with 195 shawls).\\nIf we assume that all shortages from the first order are lost as sales, the expected profit at the end of the season is thus given by the sum of the expected profit from each seven-week period and the overstock cost recovered from the first seven-week period as follows: Expected profit from season = $14,670 + 56.4 * $10 + $14,670 = $29,904 We add 56.4 ?$10 to the expected profit from the first seven-week half because there is effectively no overstock that must be sold to the discount store at the end of the first seven weeks.\\nOur analysis indicates that allowing for a second order in the season increases profits by $29,904  $29,767  $137 even if there is no improvement in forecast accuracy for the second seven-week period.\\nThe profit increase will be larger if we assume that customers who do not find the product at the end of the first seven weeks are willing to wait for the second order to arrive.\\nThe profit will increase from saving the understocking cost by a further 1.51  $110  $166.10.\\nObserve that as a result of allowing a second order, the total order quantity has decreased from 358 shawls to 195  138.6  333.6 shawls.\\nThe expected overstock at the end of the season has decreased from 79.8 to 56.4 shawls.\\nFrom our analysis, we observe three important consequences of being able to place a second replenishment order in the season after observing some sales:  .\\nwith the size of each order based on some observed sales, the buyer is better able to match supply and demand and increase profitability for Saks.\\nThese relationships are shown in Figures 13-4 and 13-5.\\nWe now consider the case in which the buyer improves her forecast accuracy for the second order after observing some of the season\\'s demand.\\nAs a result, the standard deviation of weekly demand forecast drops from 15 to 3 for the second seven-week period.\\nIn this setting, the first order stays at 195 shawls as discussed earlier.\\nFor the second order, however, we must Unsold Inventory at End of Season Number of Order Cycles per Season .\\nExpected Profit Number of Order Cycles per Season .\\naccount for the fact that the standard deviation of weekly demand has dropped to 3.\\nAs a result, we obtain Expected demand of shawls in seven weeks = m7 = 7 * 20 = 140 Standard deviation of demand over first seven weeks = s7 = 17 * 15 = 39.7 Standard deviation of demand over second seven weeks = s72 = 17 * 3 = 7.9 .\\nO2 = NORMINV(CSL*, m7, s27) = NORMINV(0.92, 140, 7.9) = 151 As in the previous analysis, we assume that the buyer is accurately able to predict sales for the first seven-week period after observing sales for the first week.\\nShe thus accounts for the overstock at the end of the first seven week period when placing her second order.\\nGiven an overstock of 56.4 shawls from the first order, the net second order is thus 151  56.4  94.6 shawls.\\nWith 151 shawls at the start of the second seven weeks, we obtain .\\nAgain observe that there is no overstock cost at the end of the first seven weeks.\\nThus, the net profits for the season are $14,670 (first seven weeks)  56.4  $10 (no overstock at the end of first seven weeks)  $15,254 (second seven weeks)  $30,488.\\nIf forecast accuracy improves as a result of observing early seasonal demand, the season\\'s profit increases by $30,488  $29,767  $721.\\nThe expected overstock at the end of the season has now declined to 11.3 units.\\nIf customers who do not find the product at the end of the first seven weeks are willing to wait for the second order to arrive, the profit increases by a further $166.10 as discussed earlier.\\nA second order and improved forecast accuracy as a result of seeing early season sales thus increase profits and decrease overstocks.\\nKey Point If quick response allows multiple replenishment orders in the season, profits increase and the overstock and understock quantity decreases.\\nMultiple replenishments allow the supply chain to better match supply and demand by being able to respond to trends rather than having to forecast them.\\nZara, the Spanish apparel retailer, built its entire strategy around quick response.\\nAt a time when most of its competitors were cutting costs by outsourcing production to low-cost countries, Zara focused on reducing response time by setting up production facilities in Spain.\\nWhile competitors had lead times that ranged from three to nine months, Zara was able to reduce its design to shelf lead times to three to four weeks.\\nGiven a three-month sales season (for each of fall, winter, spring, and summer), competitors were forced to make sourcing decisions well before the start of a season.\\nIn contrast, Zara divided the three-month sales season into three 1-month periods.\\nFor the first month, Zara decided on quantities without knowing what sales would be like.\\nThese quantities, however, were much lower than what the competition was required to order for the entire three-month season.\\nFor the second month, Zara made its production decisions after observing the first week of demand (Zara also observed demand at its  .\\nFor the third month, Zara made its production decisions after observing the entire first month of sales.\\nIn each instance, observing sales allowed Zara to significantly improve its forecast accuracy.\\nThe result was that Zara was able to bring in more of what was selling without wasting precious production capacity on what was not likely to sell.\\nQuick response allowed Zara to respond to trends rather than have to predict them.\\nThis resulted in higher profits for Zara because it produced what was selling and had less overstock and understock.\\nThe New York Times reported in 2006 that \"Zara books 85 percent of the full ticket price for its merchandise while the industry average is 60 percent.\"\\nFrom our previous discussion, quick response is clearly advantageous to a retailer in a supply chain--with one caveat.\\nAs the manufacturer reduces replenishment lead times, allowing for a second order, we have seen that the retailer\\'s order size drops.\\nIn effect, the manufacturer sells less to the retailer.\\nThus, quick response results in the manufacturer making a lower profit in the short term if all else is unchanged.\\nThis is an important point to consider, because decreasing replenishment lead times requires tremendous effort from the manufacturer, yet seems to benefit the retailer at the expense of the manufacturer.\\nThe benefits resulting from quick response should be shared appropriately across the supply chain.\\nThis was easier for Zara, which was vertically integrated into responsive manufacturing and retailing.\\nIt can be a challenge, however, for retailers who outsource manufacturing.\\nPostponement: Impact on Profits and Inventories As discussed in Chapter 12, postponement refers to the delay of product differentiation until closer to the sale of the product.\\nWith postponement, all activities prior to product differentiation require aggregate forecasts that are more accurate than individual product forecasts.\\nIndividual product forecasts are required close to the time of sale when demand is known with greater accuracy.\\nAs a result, postponement allows a supply chain to better match supply with demand.\\nPostponement can be a powerful managerial lever to increase profitability.\\nIt can be particularly valuable for online sales because of the lag that exists between the time customers place an order and when they expect delivery.\\nIf the supply chain can postpone product differentiation until after receiving the customer order, a significant increase in profits and reduction in inventories can be achieved.\\nThe major benefit of postponement arises from the improved matching of supply and demand.\\nThere is, however, a cost associated with postponement, because the production cost using postponement is typically higher than the production cost without it.\\nFor example, the production process at Benetton, where assembled knit garments are dyed, costs about 10 percent more than if dyed thread is knitted.\\nSimilarly, when retailers mix paint at stores in place of the factory, manufacturing costs increase because there is a loss of economies of scale in mixing.\\nGiven the increased production cost from postponement, a company should ensure that the inventory benefits of postponement are larger than the additional costs.\\nPostponement is valuable for a firm that sells a large variety of products with demand that is unpredictable, independent, and comparable in size.\\nWe illustrate this using the example of Benetton selling knit garments in solid colors.\\nStarting with thread, two steps are needed to complete the garment--dyeing and knitting.\\nTraditionally, thread was dyed and then the garment was knitted (Option 1).\\nBenetton developed a procedure whereby dyeing was postponed until after the garment was knitted (Option 2).\\nBenetton sells each knit garment at a retail price p  $50.\\nOption 1 (no postponement) results in a manufacturing cost of $20, whereas Option 2 (postponement) results in a manufacturing cost of $22 per garment.\\nBenetton disposes of any unsold garments at the end of the season in a clearance for s  $10 each.\\nThe knitting or manufacturing process takes a total of 20 weeks.\\nFor the sake of discussion, we assume that Benetton sells garments in four colors.\\nTwenty weeks in advance, Benetton forecasts demand for each color to be normally distributed, with a mean of   1,000 and a standard deviation of   500.\\nDemand for each color is independent.\\nWith Option 1, Benetton makes the buying decision for each color 20 weeks before the sale period and holds separate inventories for each color.\\nWith Option 2, Benetton forecasts only the aggregate  .\\nuncolored thread to purchase 20 weeks in advance.\\nThe inventory held is based on the aggregate demand across all four colors.\\nBenetton decides the quantity for individual colors after demand is known.\\nWe now quantify the impact of postponement for Benetton.\\nWith Option 1, Benetton must decide on the quantity of colored thread to purchase for each color.\\nFor each color we have  Retail price, p  $50 Manufacturing cost, c  $20 Salvage value, s  $10  .\\nCSL*  =  p p  -  c s  =  30 40  =  0.75  .\\nO* = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.75, 1000, 500) = 1,337  .\\nExpected profits = $23,664  .\\nExpected overstock = 412 Expected understock = 75  Using Option 1, across all four colors Benetton thus produces 4  1,337  5,348 sweaters.\\nThis results in an expected profit of 4  23,644  $94,576, with an average of 4  412  1,648 sweaters sold on clearance at the end of the season and 4  75  300 customers turned away for lack of sweaters.\\nUnder Option 2, Benetton has to decide only the total number of sweaters across all four colors to be produced, because they can be dyed to the appropriate color once demand is known.\\nIn this case we have  Retail price, p  $50 Manufacturing cost, c  $22 Salvage value, s  $10  .\\nCSL* =  p-c p-s  =  28 40  = 0.70  Given that demand for each color is independent, total demand across all four colors can be evaluated using Equation 12.13 to be normally distributed, with a mean of A and a standard deviation of A, where  mA = 4 * 1,000 = 4,000 sA = 14 * 500 = 1,000  .\\nOA* = NORMINV10.7, mA, sA2 = NORMINV10.7, 4000, 10002 = 4,524  .\\nExpected profits = $98,092 .\\nThe benefits of postponement decrease significantly if demand across the different colors is positively correlated.\\nIn the Benetton example, we find that postponement is not valuable if the correlation coefficient across each color is 0.2 or higher.\\nThe benefits of postponement also decrease significantly if demand is more predictable.\\nIf the standard deviation of demand for each color decreases to 300 or less, our analysis shows that Option 2 with postponement results in lower profits than Option 1 without postponement.\\nKey Point Postponement allows a firm to increase profits and better match supply and demand if the firm produces a large variety of products whose demand is unpredictable and not positively correlated, and is of about the same size.\\nPostponement is not very effective if a large fraction of demand comes from a single product.\\nThe benefit from aggregation is small in this case, whereas the increased production cost applies to all items produced.\\nWe illustrate this idea once again using Benetton as an example.\\nAssume that demand for red sweaters at Benetton is forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of red  3,100 and a standard deviation of red  800.\\nDemand for the other three colors is forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of   300 and a standard deviation of   200.\\nObserve that red sweaters constitute about 80 percent of demand.\\nUnder Option 1, the optimal cycle service level CSL* is 0.75, as evaluated earlier.\\nO  * red  =  NORMINV(CSL*, mred,  sred)  =  NORMINV(0.75,  3100, 800)  =  3,640  .\\nFor each of the other three colors, we can similarly evaluate the optimal production to be O* where  O* = NORMINV(CSL*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.75, 300, 200) = 435  This results in an expected profit of $6,458, an expected overstock of 165, and an expected understock of 30 for each of the other three colors.\\nAcross all four colors, Option 1 thus results in the following: Total production  3,640  3  435  4,945 Expected profit  $82,831  3  $6,458  $102,205 Expected overstock  659  3  165  1,154 Expected understock  119  3  30  209  .\\nUnder Option 2, Benetton has to decide only the total production across all four colors.\\nGiven that demand for each color is independent, total demand across all four colors can be evaluated using Equation 12.13 to be normally distributed, with a mean of A and a standard deviation of A, where mA = 3,100 + 3 * 300 = 4,000; sA = 28002 + 3 * 2002 = 872 Under Option 2, we repeat all calculations to obtain the following: Total production  4,457 Expected profit  $99,872 Expected overstock  623 Expected understock  166 In this case, Benetton sees its profits decline even though both overstock and understock have decreased as a result of postponement.\\nThis is because a large fraction of demand is from red sweaters, which can already be forecast with reasonably good accuracy.\\nPostponement and the resulting aggregation thus do little to improve the forecasting accuracy of red sweaters.\\nThey do, however, improve the forecasting accuracy for the other three colors, but they represent a small fraction of demand.\\nMeanwhile, the production costs increase for all sweaters (including red sweaters).\\nAs a result, the increased production costs outweigh the benefits from postponement across all colors.\\nKey Point Postponement may reduce overall profits for a firm if a single product contributes the majority of the demand because the increased manufacturing expense due to postponement outweighs the small benefit that aggregation provides in this case.\\nNext, we discuss how tailored postponement can be an effective strategy when complete postponement is not appropriate.\\nTailored Postponement: Impact on Profits and Inventories In tailored postponement, a firm uses production with postponement to satisfy a part of its demand, with the rest being satisfied without postponement.\\nTailored postponement produces higher profits than when no postponement is used or all products are manufactured using postponement.\\nUnder tailored postponement, a firm produces the amount that is likely to sell using the lower-cost production method without postponement.\\nThe firm produces the portion of demand that is uncertain using postponement.\\nOn the portion of the demand that is certain, postponement provides little value in terms of increased forecast accuracy.\\nThe firm thus produces that portion using the lower-cost method to lower manufacturing cost.\\nOn the portion of demand that is uncertain, postponement significantly improves forecast accuracy.\\nThe firm is thus willing to incur the increased production cost to achieve the benefit from the improved matching of supply and demand.\\nWe illustrate the idea of tailored postponement, returning to the example of Benetton.\\nOne way to implement tailored postponement is to produce high-demand, predictable products without postponement and produce only the unpredictable products using postponement.\\nLet us return to the Benetton data with red sweaters constituting about 80 percent of demand.\\nRecall that demand for red sweaters at Benetton is forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of red  3,100 and a standard deviation of red  800.\\nDemand for the other three colors is forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of   300 and a standard deviation of   200.\\nWe evaluated that postponing all colors decreases profits for Benetton by more than  .\\n$2,000 (from $102,205 to $99,872).\\nHowever, if we tailor postponement so that red sweaters are made using the traditional method and only the other colors are postponed, profits actually increase by $1,009 to $103,213.\\nA more sophisticated approach to postponement separates all demand into base load and variation.\\nThe base load is manufactured using the low-cost method without postponement, and only the variation is made using postponement.\\nThis more sophisticated form of tailored sourcing is more complex to implement but can be valuable even when all products being postponed have similar demand as we illustrate next.\\nConsider the scenario in which Benetton is selling four colors, and the forecast demand for each color is normally distributed, with a mean of   1,000 and a standard deviation of   500.\\nWe have observed earlier that the use of complete postponement (every sweater is postponed) in this instance increases profits at Benetton from $94,576 to $98,092.\\nWe now consider a situation in which Benetton applies tailored postponement and uses both Option 1 (dye thread and then knit garment) and Option 2 (dye knit garment) for production.\\nFor each color, Benetton identifies a quantity Q1 (the base load) to be manufactured using Option 1 and an aggregate quantity QA to be manufactured using Option 2, with colors for the aggregate quantity being assigned when demand is known.\\nWe now identify the appropriate tailored postponement policy and its impact on profits and inventories.\\nThere is no formula that can be used to evaluate the optimal policy and profits in this case.\\nWe thus resort to simulations to study the impact of different policies.\\nThe results of various simulations are shown in Table 13-4.\\nFrom Table 13-4, we see that Benetton can increase its expected profit to $104,603 by using a tailored postponement policy under which 800 units of each color are produced using Option 1 and 1,550 units are produced using Option 2.\\nThe resulting profit is higher than if all units are produced entirely using Option 1 (no postponement) or Option 2 (complete postponement).\\nIt is quite likely that demand for each color will be 800 or higher.\\nThe tailored postponement policy exploits this fact and produces these units using Option 1, which has a low cost.\\nThe remaining units are produced using Option 2 so that demand uncertainty can be reduced by aggregation.\\nKey Point Tailored postponement allows a firm to increase its profitability by postponing only the uncertain part of the demand and producing the predictable part at a lower cost without postponement.\\nTailored postponement is more profitable than either no postponement or complete postponement but can be complex to implement.\\nTable 13-4

well, and the other focusing on flexibility to handle uncertainty, but at a higher cost.\\nFor tailored sourcing to be effective, having supply sources such that one serves as the backup to the other is not sufficient.\\nThe two sources must focus on different capabilities.\\nThe low-cost source must focus on being efficient and should be required to supply only the predictable portion of the demand.\\nThe flexible source should focus on being responsive and be required to supply the uncertain portion of the demand.\\nAs a result, tailored sourcing allows a firm to increase its profits and better match supply and demand.\\nThe value of tailored sourcing depends on the reduction in cost that can be achieved as a result of one source facing no variability.\\nIf this benefit is small, tailored sourcing may not be ideal because of the added complexity of implementation.\\nTailored sourcing may be volume based or product based, depending on the source of uncertainty.\\nIn volume-based tailored sourcing, the predictable part of a product\\'s demand is produced at an efficient facility, whereas the uncertain portion is produced at a flexible facility.\\nBenetton provides an example of volume-based tailored sourcing.\\nBenetton requires retailers to commit to about 65 percent of their orders about seven months before the start of the sales season.\\nBenetton subcontracts production of this portion without uncertainty to low-cost sources that have long lead times of several months.\\nFor the other 35 percent, Benetton allows retailers to place orders much closer to or even after the start of the selling season.\\nAll uncertainty is concentrated in this portion of the order.\\nBenetton produces this portion of the order in a plant it owns that is very flexible.\\nProduction at the Benetton plant is more expensive than production at the subcontractor\\'s.\\nHowever, the plant can produce with a lead time of weeks, whereas subcontractors have a lead time of several months.\\nA combination of the two sources allows Benetton to reduce its inventories while incurring a high cost of production for only a fraction of its demand.\\nThis allows it to increase profits.\\nVolume-based tailored sourcing should be considered by firms that have moved a lot of their production overseas to take advantage of lower costs.\\nThe lower costs have also been accompanied by longer lead times.\\nIn such a situation, having a flexible local source with short lead times can be an effective complement to the long lead time overseas supplier even if the local source is more expensive.\\nLong lead times require large safety inventories, and the resulting mismatch of supply and demand hurts profits.\\nThe presence of the local source allows the firm to carry lower safety inventories and supply any excess demand from the local source.\\nThe most effective combination is for the overseas source to focus on replenishing cycle inventories, ignoring uncertainty.\\nThe local source is used as a backup any time demand exceeds the inventory available.\\nAllon and Van Mieghem (2010) describe a high-tech manufacturer of wireless transmission components with facilities in China and Mexico.\\nThe Chinese facility was cheaper but had lead times that were five to ten times longer than those from Mexico.\\nA simulation study indicated that the use of tailored sourcing was the most effective strategy in this case.\\nAllon and Van Mieghem (2010) recommend a tailored base-surge (TBS) inventory policy whereby a constant base load is sourced from the cheaper source (China in this case), with the responsive source (Mexico in this case) being used any time inventory dropped below a threshold.\\nTheir simulations indicate that sourcing roughly 75 percent of the demand from the cheaper source as base load with the rest coming from the responsive source as needed is a fairly effective tailored sourcing policy in practice.\\nTheir results show that the fraction of demand allocated as base load to the cheaper source increases as the demand and the cost difference with the responsive facility grows.\\nThe fraction of demand allocated as base load to the cheaper source decreases as the reliability of the cheaper source decreases or the volatility of demand and the holding cost of inventory grow.\\nIn product-based tailored sourcing, low-volume products with uncertain demand are obtained from a flexible source whereas high-volume products with less demand uncertainty are obtained from an efficient source.\\nAn example of product-based tailored sourcing is Levi Strauss.\\nstandard-sized jeans as well as jeans that can be customized.\\nStandard jeans have relatively stable demand, whereas demand for custom jeans is unpredictable.\\nCustom jeans are produced at a flexible facility, whereas standard jeans are produced at an efficient facility.\\nZara also follows such a productbased tailored sourcing strategy, obtaining more than half its production from responsive plants in Europe with the rest coming from lower cost plants in Asia.\\nIts most fashionable items that have the least predictable demand are made in responsive European facilities.\\nClothes that are more predictable and can sell for longer periods, such as basic T-shirts, are sourced from the cheaper Asian facilities.\\nIn some instances, new products have uncertain demand while well-established products have more stable demand.\\nProduct-based tailored sourcing may be implemented with a flexible facility focusing on new products, and efficient facilities focusing on the well-established products.\\nThis is often the case in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nIn our discussion up to this point, we have assumed that a firm can set its desired level of product availability, and no constraints interfere with this choice.\\nA common scenario in which this assumption fails occurs when the desired level of product availability results in an order size that exceeds the available capacity at the supplier.\\nWhen ordering a single product, it is optimal for the buyer to order the minimum of the available capacity and the optimal order quantity.\\nWhen ordering multiple products, however, the buyer needs to consider the trade-off between ordering more of one product versus another.\\nExpected marginal contribution for high-end sweater = MC111,0002 = p1[1 - F111,0002] + s1F111,0002 - c1 = 150 * 11 - 0.52 + 35 * 0.5 - 50 = $42.50  .\\nExpected marginal contribution for mid-range sweater = MC211,9992 = p2[1 - F211,9992] + s2F211,9992 - c2 = 100 * 11 - 0.4992 + 25 * 0.499 - 40 = $22.57 Clearly, it is better to allocate the last unit of capacity to the high-end sweater rather than the mid-range sweater.\\nIn fact, changing the order size to 1,001 high-end sweaters and 1,999 mid-range sweaters increases the expected profits by almost $20.\\nOne can now decrease the order size for the mid-range sweater to 1,998 and ask how the last unit of capacity should be allocated.\\nRepeating the above procedure indicates that the order size for the high-end sweaters should be increased to at least 1,002.\\nIn fact, the order size for the high-end sweater should be increased until the expected marginal contribution for the high-end sweater is the same as that for the mid-range sweater.\\nAt that point, it no longer makes sense to move capacity from one type of sweater to another.\\nThe optimal allocation of capacity turns out to be 1,089 high-end sweaters and 1,911 mid-range sweaters.\\nThe expected profits for this order size are $195,152.\\nObserve that at optimality, the high-end sweater is allocated a relatively high share of the available capacity because its margin relative to the cost of overstocking is higher than that of the midrange sweater.\\nThe idea of allocating the available capacity to the product with the highest expected marginal contribution can be converted into a solution procedure.\\nLet each product i have a mean demand of i and a standard deviation of i.\\nProduct i has a retail price of pi, a cost ci, and a salvage value of si.\\nIf quantity Qi is allocated to product i, the expected marginal contribution is obtained as MCi1Qi2 = pi[1 - Fi1Qi2] + siFi1Qi2 - ci The following procedure allocates each unit of capacity to the product with the highest expected marginal contribution.\\nLet B be the total available capacity.\\nSet quantity Qi  0 for all products i.\\nCompute the expected marginal contribution MCi(Qi) for each product i.\\nIf no expected marginal contribution is positive, stop.\\nOtherwise, let j be the product with the highest expected marginal contribution.\\nIncrease Qj by one unit.\\nIf the total quantity across all products is less than B, return to step 2.\\nOtherwise, the capac- ity constraint has been met and the current quantities are optimal.\\nPartial results from the application of the procedure described above to the department store data are shown in Table 13-5. .\\nSubject to  n Max a 罧1Qi2 i=1  n a Qi ... B i=1 Qi ?0  .\\nTable 13-5 Application of Solution Procedure to Obtain Order Quantities Under Capacity Constraints  Expected Marginal Contribution  Order Quantity  Capacity Left  High End  Mid Range

When ordering multiple products under a limited supply capacity, the allocation of capacity to products should be based on their expected marginal contribution to profits.\\nThis approach allocates a relatively higher fraction of capacity to products that have a high margin relative to their cost of overstocking.\\nBeware of preset levels of availability.\\nOften companies have a preset target of product availability without any justification.\\nIn such a situation, managers should probe the rationale for the targeted level of product availability.\\nA manager can provide significant value by adjusting the targeted level of product availability to one that maximizes profits.\\nUse approximate costs because profit-maximizing solutions are quite robust.\\nCompanies should avoid spending an inordinate amount of effort to get exact estimates of various costs used to evaluate optimal levels of product availability.\\nLevels of product availability close to optimal will often produce a profit that is close to the optimal profit.\\nThus, it is not crucial that all costs be estimated precisely.\\nA reasonable approximation of the costs will generally produce targeted levels of product availability that are close to optimal.\\nEstimate a range for the cost of stocking out.\\nFirms\\' efforts to set levels of product availability often get bogged down in debate over the cost of stocking out.\\nThe sometimes controversial nature of this cost and its hard-to-quantify components (such as loss of customer goodwill) make it a difficult number for people from different functions to agree on.\\nHowever, it is often not necessary to estimate a precise cost of stocking out.\\nUsing a range of the cost, a manager can identify appropriate levels of availability and the associated profits.\\ndo not change significantly in the range, thus eliminating the need for a more precise estimation of the cost of stocking out.\\nTailor your response to uncertainty.\\nA manager should recognize that strategies such as quick response and postponement are most effective when the underlying unpredictability is large.\\nThus, for the portion of demand that is relatively predictable, one should focus on the lowest cost production method, even if it is not responsive.\\nThe unpredictable portion of demand, however, should be served using a more responsive approach (postponement or quick response), even if it is more expensive.\\nIdentify the factors affecting the optimal level of product availability and evaluate the optimal cycle service level.\\nThe cost of overstocking by one unit and the lost current and future margin from understocking by one unit are the two major factors that affect the optimal level of product availability.\\nThe optimal level of availability is obtained by balancing the costs of overstocking and understocking.\\nAs the cost of overstocking increases, it is optimal to lower the targeted level of product availability.\\nAs the lost margin from being out of stock increases, it is optimal to raise the targeted level of product availability.\\nUse managerial levers that improve supply chain profitability through optimal service levels.\\nA manager may increase supply chain profitability by (a) increasing the salvage value of each unit overstocked, (b) decreasing the margin lost from a stockout, (c) using improved forecasting to reduce demand uncertainty, (d) using quick response to reduce lead times and allow multiple orders in a season, (e) using postponement to delay product differentiation, and (f) using tailored sourcing with a flexible short lead time supply source serving as a backup for a low-cost supply source.\\nUnderstand conditions under which postponement is valuable in a supply chain.\\nPostponement is valuable in a supply chain when a firm sells a large variety of products with highly unpredictable demand of about the same size that is not positively correlated.\\nPostponement is not as valuable if demand becomes predictable or positively correlated.\\nPostponement is also not as valuable if a large fraction of the demand comes from a few products.\\nIn such a setting, tailored postponement is most effective whereby base loads are not postponed but the variation is postponed.\\nAllocate limited supply capacity among multiple products to maximize expected profits.\\nWhen available supply capacity is limited, it should be allocated among products based on their expected marginal contribution to profits.\\nAt the optimal allocation, the expected marginal contribution of each product is the same.\\nWhen there is no capacity constraint, the expected marginal contribution of each product at optimality is zero.\\n Understand the role of transportation in a supply chain.\\nEvaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different modes of transportation.\\nDiscuss the role of infrastructure and policies in transportation.\\nIdentify the relative strengths and weaknesses of various transportation network design options.\\nIdentify trade-offs that shippers need to consider when designing a transportation network.\\nIn this chapter, we discuss the role of transportation within a supply chain and identify trade-offs that need to be considered when making transportation decisions.\\nOur goal is to enable managers to make transportation strategy and design, planning, and operational decisions with an understanding of all the important pros and cons of their choices.\\nTransportation refers to the movement of product from one location to another as it makes its way from the beginning of a supply chain to the customer.\\nTransportation is an important supply chain driver because products are rarely produced and consumed in the same location.\\nTransportation is a significant component of the costs incurred by most supply chains.\\nAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), \"over 19 billion tons of freight, valued at $13 trillion, was carried over 4.4 trillion ton-miles in the United States in 2002.\\n\"1 Only three sectors-- housing, health care, and food--contributed a larger share to the gross domestic product (GDP) than transportation.\\nTransportation-related jobs employed nearly 20 million people in 2002, accounting for 16 percent of U.S. total occupational employment.\\nThe role of transportation is even more significant in global supply chains.\\nAccording to the BTS, the U.S. freight transportation network carried export and import merchandise worth more than $2.2 trillion in 2004, an increase of 168 percent from $822 billion in 1990.\\nDuring the same period, the ratio of exports from and imports into the United States to the GDP increased from 12 percent to 21 percent.\\n1 Freight in America, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, January 2006.\\nAny supply chain\\'s success is closely linked to the appropriate use of transportation.\\nIKEA, the Scandinavian home furnishings retailer, has built a global network with about 270 stores in 26 countries primarily on the basis of effective transportation.\\nIKEA\\'s sales for the year ending August 2009 reached 21.5 billion euros.\\nIts strategy is built around providing good-quality products at low prices.\\nIts goal is to cut prices by 2 to 3 percent each year.\\nAs a result, IKEA works hard to find the most inexpensive global source for each of its products.\\nModular design of its furniture allows IKEA to transport its goods worldwide much more cost effectively than a traditional furniture manufacturer.\\nThe large size of IKEA stores and shipments allows inexpensive transportation of home furnishings all the way to the retail store.\\nEffective sourcing and inexpensive transportation allow IKEA to provide high-quality home furnishings at low prices globally.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan is another firm that has used transportation to achieve its strategic goals.\\nThe company has a goal of carrying products in its stores to match the needs of customers as they vary by geographic location or time of day.\\nTo help achieve this goal, Seven-Eleven Japan uses a responsive transportation system that replenishes its stores several times a day so that the products available match customers\\' needs.\\nProducts from different suppliers are aggregated on trucks according to the required temperature to help achieve frequent deliveries at a reasonable cost.\\nSeven-Eleven Japan uses a responsive transportation system along with aggregation to decrease its transportation and receiving costs while ensuring that product availability closely matches customer demand.\\nSupply chains also use responsive transportation to centralize inventories and operate with fewer facilities.\\nFor example, Amazon relies on package carriers and the postal system to deliver customer orders from centralized warehouses.\\nTransportation has allowed Netflix to operate a movie rental business without any stores.\\nThe company uses responsive transportation provided by the postal system along with suitably located warehouses to allow its customers to receive and return movies they want to watch.\\nThe shipper is the party that requires the movement of the product between two points in the supply chain.\\nThe carrier is the party that moves or transports the product.\\nFor example, when Netflix uses USPS to ship its DVDs from the warehouse to the customer, Netflix is the shipper and USPS is the carrier.\\nBesides the shipper and the carrier, two other parties have a significant impact on transportation: (1) the owners and operators of transportation infrastructure such as roads, ports, canals, and airports and (2) the bodies that set transportation policy worldwide.\\nActions by all four parties influence the effectiveness of transportation.\\nTo understand transportation in a supply chain, it is important to consider the perspectives of all four parties.\\nA carrier makes investment decisions regarding the transportation equipment (locomotives, trucks, airplanes, etc.)\\nand in some cases infrastructure (rail) and then makes operating decisions to try to maximize the return from these assets.\\nA shipper, in contrast, uses transportation to minimize the total cost (transportation, inventory, information, sourcing, and facility) while providing an appropriate level of responsiveness to the customer.\\nThe effectiveness of carriers is influenced by infrastructure such as ports, roads, waterways, and airports.\\nMost transportation infrastructure throughout the world is owned and managed as a public good.\\nIt is important that infrastructure be managed in such a way that monies are available for maintenance and investment in further capacity as needed.\\nTransportation policy sets direction for the amount of national resources that go into improving transportation infrastructure.\\nTransportation policy also aims to prevent abuse of monopoly power; promote fair competition; and balance environmental, energy, and social concerns in transportation.\\nIn the following sections, we discuss issues that are important from the perspective of carriers, infrastructure owners and operators, transportation policy makers, and shippers.\\nIn the next section, we discuss different modes of transportation and their cost and performance characteristics.\\nSupply chains use a combination of the following modes of transportation: ?Air ?Package carriers ?Truck ?Rail ?Water ?Pipeline ?Intermodal Commercial freight activity in the United States by mode in 2002 and the value added by each mode to GDP in 2009 is summarized in Table 14-1.\\nBefore discussing the various modes, it is important to highlight some important trends in the U.S. economy.\\nBetween 1970 and 2002, U.S. real GDP, measured in year 2000 dollars, grew by 176 percent.\\nOver the same period, U.S. freight transportation measured in ton-miles grew by only 73 percent.\\nIn 1970, it took 2.1 ton-miles of freight transportation to produce $1 of goods GDP.\\nIn 2002, it took only 1.1 ton-miles to produce $1 of GDP.\\nThis trend reflects the downsizing of products with new technology and the improved efficiency of the freight transportation system.\\nThis trend has continued since 2002.\\nThe effectiveness of any mode of transport is affected by equipment investments and operating decisions by the carrier and the available infrastructure and transportation policies.\\nThe carrier\\'s primary objective is to ensure good utilization of its assets while providing customers with an acceptable level of service.\\nCarrier decisions are affected by equipment cost, fixed operating cost, variable operating costs, the responsiveness the carrier seeks to provide its target segment, and the prices that the market will bear.\\nFor example, FedEx designed a hub-and-spoke airline network for transporting packages to provide fast, reliable delivery times.\\nUPS, in contrast, uses a combination of aircrafts, rail, and trucks to provide less expensive transportation with somewhat longer delivery times.\\nThe difference between the two transportation networks is reflected in the pricing schedule.\\nFedEx next day delivery charges are based primarily on package size.\\nUPS, in contrast, charges based on both size and destination.\\nFrom a supply chain perspective, a hub-and-spoke air network is more appropriate when prices are independent of destination and rapid delivery is important, whereas a trucking network is more appropriate when prices vary with destination and a somewhat slower delivery is acceptable.\\nAir Major airlines in the United States that carry both passenger and cargo include American, Southwest, United, and Delta.\\nAirlines have three cost components: (1) a fixed cost of infrastructure  Table 14-1 Transportation Facts  Mode  Freight Value  Freight Tons Freight Ton-Miles  ($ billions) in 2002 (billions) in 2002 (millions) in 2002  Air (includes truck and air) Truck Rail Water Pipeline Multimodal  563 9,075 392 673 896 1,121  6 11,712 1,979 1,668 3,529 229  13 1,515 1,372

and fuel that is independent of the passengers or cargo on a flight but is fixed for a flight, and (3) a variable cost that depends on the passengers or cargo carried.\\nGiven that most of the cost of a flight is incurred when it takes off, an important objective of an airline is to maximize the revenue generated per flight.\\nAs a result, revenue management (see Chapter 16) is a significant factor in the success of passenger airlines.\\nAir carriers offer a fast and fairly expensive mode of transportation for cargo.\\nSmall, high-value items or time-sensitive emergency shipments that have to travel a long distance are best suited for air transport.\\nAir carriers normally move shipments under 500 pounds, including high-value but lightweight high-tech products.\\nGiven the growth in high technology, the weight of freight carried by air has diminished over the past two decades even as the value of the freight has increased somewhat.\\nIn 2002, the goods U.S. businesses moved by air were valued at $75,000 per ton, by far the highest among all modes.\\nThe airline industry in Asia has seen significant growth in the 21st century, especially in China and India.\\nIn the United States, the industry has had a difficult time, with several carriers declaring bankruptcy in the first decade of the 21st century.\\nThis was followed by consolidation in the industry in the United States and Western Europe.\\nAfter steep losses in 2008 and 2009, the industry has been profitable since 2010.\\nKey issues that air carriers face include identifying the location and number of hubs, assigning planes to routes, setting up maintenance schedules for planes, scheduling crews, and managing prices and availability at different prices.\\nPackage Carriers Package carriers are transportation companies such as FedEx, UPS, and the U.S.\\nPostal Service, which carry small packages ranging from letters to shipments weighing about 150 pounds.\\nPackage carriers use air, truck, and rail to transport time-critical smaller packages.\\nPackage carriers are expensive and cannot compete with LTL carriers on price for large shipments.\\nThe major service they offer shippers is rapid and reliable delivery.\\nThus, shippers use package carriers for small and time-sensitive shipments.\\nPackage carriers also provide other value-added services such as package tracking and in some cases processing and assembly of products.\\nPackage carriers are the preferred mode of transport for online businesses such as Amazon and Dell, as well as for companies such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr that send small packages to customers.\\nWith the growth in online sales, the use of package carriers has increased significantly over the past few years.\\nPackage carriers seek out smaller and more time-sensitive shipments than air cargo carriers, especially when tracking and other value-added services are important to the shipper.\\nGiven the small size of packages and several delivery points, consolidation of shipments is a key factor in increasing utilization and decreasing costs for package carriers.\\nPackage carriers have trucks that make local deliveries and pick up packages.\\nPackages are then taken to large sorting centers from which they are sent by full truckload, rail, or air to the sorting center closest to the delivery point.\\nFrom the delivery-point sorting center, the package is sent to customers on small trucks making milk runs (discussed later in the chapter).\\nKey issues in this industry include the location and capacity of transfer points and information capability to facilitate and track package flow.\\nFor the final delivery to a customer, an important consideration is the scheduling and routing of the delivery trucks.\\nTruck In most of the world, trucks carry a significant fraction of the goods moved.\\nIn 2002, trucks moved 69.5 percent of U.S commercial freight by value and 60.1 percent by weight.2 The trucking industry consists of two major segments--truckload (TL) or less than truckload (LTL).\\nTrucking 2 Freight in America, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2006.  .\\nis more expensive than rail but offers the advantage of door-to-door shipment and a shorter delivery time.\\nIt also has the advantage of requiring no transfer between pickup and delivery.\\nTL operations have relatively low fixed costs, and owning a few trucks is often sufficient to enter the business.\\nThis industry is characterized by shipments of 10,000 pounds or more, and more than 50,000 carriers offer TL services in the United States.\\nThe challenge in the TL business is that most markets have an imbalance of inbound and outbound flows.\\nFor example, New York has a significantly higher inflow of material than outflow.\\nThe goal of a TL carrier is to schedule shipments that provide high revenue while minimizing trucks\\' idle and empty travel time.\\nThis is best done by designing routes that pick up loads from markets where outbound demand exceeds inbound supply because these markets tend to offer the highest prices.\\nLTL operations are priced to encourage shipments in small lots, usually less than half a TL, as TL tends to be cheaper for larger shipments.\\nLTL is suited for shipments that are too large to be mailed as small packages (typically more than 150 lbs.)\\nbut that constitute less than half a TL.\\nLTL operators tend to run regional or national hub-and-spoke networks that allow consolidation of partial loads.\\nLTL shipments take longer than TL shipments because of other loads that need to be picked up and dropped off.\\nTo reduce accidents on the road caused by driver fatigue, the U.S. Department of Transportation issues hours-of-service regulations that limit work periods for truck drivers.\\nFatiguerelated accidents correlate with the number of hours of driving and increase with the total length of the driver\\'s trip.\\nBoth TL and LTL carriers must design their routes taking these rules into account.\\nRail In 2002, rail carried about 3 percent of U.S. shipments by value, 10 percent by weight, and more than 30 percent of total ton-miles.\\nThese figures reflect the use of rail to move commodities over large distances.\\nRail carriers incur a high fixed cost in terms of tracks, locomotives, cars, and yards.\\nA significant trip-related labor and fuel cost is independent of the number of cars (fuel costs do vary somewhat with the number of cars) but does vary with the distance traveled and the time taken.\\nAny idle time, once a train is powered, is expensive because labor and fuel costs are incurred even though trains are not moving.\\nIdle time occurs when trains exchange cars for different destinations.\\nIt also occurs because of track congestion.\\nLabor and fuel together account for more than 60 percent of railroad expense.\\nFrom an operational perspective, it is thus important for railroads to keep locomotives and crews well utilized.\\nThe price structure and the heavy load capability make rail an ideal mode for carrying large, heavy, or high-density products over long distances.\\nTransportation time by rail, however, can be long.\\nRail is thus ideal for heavy, low-value shipments that are not time sensitive.\\nCoal, for example, is a major part of each railroad\\'s shipments.\\nSmall, time-sensitive, short-distance or short lead time shipments rarely go by rail.\\nA major goal for railroad firms is to keep locomotives and crews well utilized.\\nMajor operational issues at railroads include vehicle and staff scheduling, track and terminal delays, and poor on-time performance.\\nRailroad performance is hurt by the large amount of time taken at each transition.\\nThe travel time is usually a small fraction of the total time for a rail shipment.\\nDelays get exaggerated because trains today are typically not scheduled but \"built.\"\\nIn other words, a train leaves once there are enough cars to constitute the train.\\nCars wait for the train to build, adding to the uncertainty of the delivery time for a shipper.\\nA railroad can improve on-time performance by scheduling some of the trains instead of building all of them.\\nIn such a setting, a more sophisticated pricing strategy that includes revenue management (see Chapter 16) needs to be instituted for scheduled trains.\\nWater Major global ocean carriers include Maersk, Evergreen Group, American President Lines, and Hanjin Shipping Co. Water transport, by its nature, is limited to certain areas.\\nUnited States, water transport takes place via the inland waterway system (the Great Lakes and rivers) or coastal waters.\\nWater transport is ideally suited for carrying large loads at low cost.\\nWithin the United States, water transport is used primarily for the movement of large bulk commodity shipments and is the cheapest mode for carrying such loads.\\nIt is, however, the slowest of all the modes, and significant delays occur at ports and terminals.\\nThis makes water transport difficult to operate for short-haul trips, although it is used effectively in Japan and parts of Europe for daily short-haul trips of a few miles.\\nWithin the United States, the passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 has been a significant event for water transport.\\nThis act allows carriers and shippers to enter into confidential contracts, effectively deregulating the industry.\\nThe act is similar to the deregulation that occurred in the trucking and airline industries more than two decades ago and is likely to have a similar impact on the shipping industry.\\nIn global trade, water transport is the dominant mode for shipping all kinds of products.\\nCars, grain, apparel, and other products are shipped by sea.\\nIn 2001, merchandise trade valued at more than $718 billion moved between the United States and foreign seaports.\\nMaritime transportation accounted for 78 percent of the U.S. international merchandise freight by weight in 2002.\\nFor the quantities shipped and the distances involved in international trade, water transport is by far the cheapest mode of transport.\\nA significant trend in maritime trade worldwide has been the growth in the use of containers.\\nThis has led to a demand for larger, faster, and more specialized vessels to improve the economics of container transport.\\nDelays at ports, customs, and security and the management of containers used are major issues in global shipping.\\nPort congestion in particular has been a big problem in the United States.\\nPipeline Pipeline is used primarily for the transport of crude petroleum, refined petroleum products, and natural gas.\\nIn the United States, pipeline accounted for about 16 percent of total ton-miles in 2002.\\nA significant initial fixed cost is incurred in setting up the pipeline and related infrastructure that does not vary significantly with the diameter of the pipeline.\\nPipeline operations are typically optimized at about 80 to 90 percent of pipeline capacity.\\nGiven the nature of the costs, pipelines are best suited when relatively stable and large flows are required.\\nPipeline may be an effective way of getting crude oil to a port or a refinery.\\nSending gasoline to a gas station does not justify investment in a pipeline and is done better with a truck.\\nPipeline pricing usually consists of two components--a fixed component related to the shipper\\'s peak usage and a second charge relating to the actual quantity transported.\\nThis pricing structure encourages the shipper to use the pipeline for the predictable component of demand with other modes often being used to cover fluctuations.\\nIntermodal Intermodal transportation is the use of more than one mode of transport to move a shipment to its destination.\\nA variety of intermodal combinations are possible, with the most common being truck/rail.\\nIntermodal traffic has grown considerably with the increased use of containers for shipping and the rise of global trade.\\nContainers are easy to transfer from one mode to another, and their use facilitates intermodal transportation.\\nContainerized freight often uses truck/ water/rail combinations, particularly for global freight.\\nFor global trade, intermodal is often the only option because factories and markets may not be next to ports.\\nAs the quantity shipped using containers has grown, the truck/water/rail intermodal combination has also grown.\\nBy 2001, intermodal activity contributed more than 20 percent of rail revenues.3 On land, the rail/truck 3 \"The Value of Rail Intermodal to the U.S. Economy,\" accessed on April 29, 2011, from http://intermodal.transportation.\\norg/Documents/brown.pdf.\\nintermodal system offers the benefit of lower cost than TL and delivery times that are better than rail, thereby bringing together different modes of transport to create a price/service offering that cannot be matched by any single mode.\\nIt also creates convenience for shippers who now deal with only one entity representing all carriers that together provide the intermodal service.\\nKey issues in the intermodal industry involve the exchange of information to facilitate shipment transfers between different modes because these transfers often involve considerable delays, hurting delivery time performance.\\nRoads, seaports, airports, rail, and canals are some of the major infrastructural elements that exist along nodes and links of a transportation network.\\nIn almost all countries, the government has either taken full responsibility or played a significant role in building and managing these infrastructure elements.\\nImproved infrastructure has played a significant role in the development of transportation and the resulting growth of trade.\\nThe role of the railroads and canals in the economic development of the United States is well documented.\\nMore recently, the impact of improved road, air, and port infrastructure on the development in China is very visible.\\nBefore considering policy questions related to transportation infrastructures, it is worth looking at the history of rail and road infrastructure in the United States to see some of the issues involved.\\nWe summarize some of the discussion by Ellison (2002) of the history of railroads and regulation in the industry.\\nThe construction of railroads in the United States occurred rapidly during the 1850s.\\nThe railroads were privately owned but were built with significant government subsidy, often in the form of land grants.\\nBy the 1870s, the railroad network connected most of the United States.\\nEach railroad was the exclusive provider of carriage over its track.\\nThis monopoly allowed railroads to determine the price they charged as well as the level of service they provided their customers.\\nInitial construction of new railroads led to some competition over rates.\\nThe railroad companies responded by entering into agreements with each other that effectively ended competition and raised rates.\\nProtests by farmers and other users of the railroads led eventually to the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which prohibited discriminatory pricing.\\nThe ICC required railroads to file their rates with the ICC and made them public.\\nThe railroads responded by forming cartels to restrict supply.\\nThis led to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890.\\nResponding to the financial difficulties of railways in the 1940s, the government allowed them some degree of coordination and exempted them from the antitrust regulations.\\nWith the growth of other modes of transport and the need to revitalize their assets, the railroads were in bad financial shape in the early 1970s.\\nThe Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated the railroads, allowed them some rate-making powers, and eased entry and exit.\\nThe act also removed the antitrust immunity of the railroads.\\nDeregulation in the United States was followed by a wave of reorganization and mergers within the railroad industry.\\nOverall, deregulation has resulted in improved financial performance of the railroad industry and increased use of rail by shippers.\\nLevinson (1998) provides an excellent discussion of the history of road construction and pricing.\\nIn the late 1700s, turnpikes were built using public funds in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania but were then turned over to private companies that collected tolls.\\nOver time, other turnpikes were built as a result of competition between towns to gain trade.\\nOther than federal land grants, these roads were typically built with local effort and money.\\nThe tolls on these turnpikes were generally structured to keep local travel free and make people traveling across an area pay for this right.\\nWith the growth in railroads and canals, turnpikes suffered financially in the mid-1800s and were eventually converted into public roads.\\nIn the 20th century, as the modes of transport changed, there was a need for higher quality roads.\\nA network of national toll-free highways was built, largely using gasoline taxes as the source of funding.\\nAt the same time, other facilities such as tunnels and bridges were often constructed as toll facilities.\\nIn many other countries, such as France and Spain, concessions were granted to private companies that received toll revenue.\\nMore recently, private toll roads have also been built in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.\\nFrom these examples, it seems reasonable that the government has to either own or regulate a monopolistic transportation infrastructure asset.\\nWhen the transportation infrastructure asset has competition either within a mode or across modes, private ownership, deregulation, and competition seem to work well.\\nThe deregulation of the transportation industry within the United States is a case in point.\\nKeep in mind, however, that roads, ports, and airports are largely public and not private because of the inherently monopolistic nature of these transportation infrastructure assets.\\nIn such a setting, the public ownership of these assets is justified.\\nThis raises the policy question of financing the construction and maintenance of these publicly owned transportation assets.\\nShould roads be financed through a gasoline tax, or is some other form of financing such as tolls more appropriate?\\nSome economists have argued for public ownership of these assets with the setting of quasi-market prices to improve overall efficiency.\\nQuasi-market prices need to take into account the discrepancy between the incentives of an individual using the transportation infrastructure and the public as a whole that owns the infrastructure.\\nThis discrepancy is illustrated in Figure 14-1 in the context of road traffic.\\nA vehicle driver bases his or her decision to use a highway on the cost and benefit of doing so.\\nFigure 14-1 assumes that different people have different value for making the trip and this value is uniformly distributed over an interval.\\nThe number of users whose value from a trip exceeds a particular cost is thus defined by the demand curve.\\nWe assume a simple demand curve given by traffic f  1,000  cost.\\nThe costs incurred by a motorist include any tolls and the cost of time spent on the highway and the cost of operating and maintaining the vehicle.\\nIt is well known that the time spent increases with congestion on a highway.\\nThus, the average cost to each motorist increases with traffic flow as shown in Figure 14-1.\\nWe start with the case when there are no tolls and motorists only incur costs related to congestion, operation, and maintenance.\\nWe assume that the total cost grows with traffic f and is given by total cost  3f 2.\\nThe average cost per motorist is thus given by cost = 3f 2 f  3f.\\nSince there are no tolls for accessing the highway, demand will materialize based on the average congestion, operation, and maintenance cost incurred by people on the road.\\nGiven people\\'s valuation of the trip, the number of motorists using the road is determined by the intersection of the demand curve with the average cost curve at point A as shown in Figure 14-1.\\nFor our demand curve f  1,000 ?cost and average cost function cost  3f, we obtain f  1,000  cost  1,000 ?3f.\\nSolving this equation for f, we obtain f  1,0004  250 motorists at equilibrium.\\nThis results in an average cost to motorists of P0  3f  3 ?250  750 and a traffic flow of Q0  f  250.\\nMarginal cost of time + operation B Average cost of PP10 A time + operation Demand Curve Q1 Q0 Vehicle Flow Rate .\\nFrom the perspective of the public, however, it is more appropriate to consider how each additional motorist impacts the total cost, not just the average cost.\\nObserve that an additional motorist increases the average cost 3f by a small amount but increases the total cost 3f 2 across all motorists by a much larger amount.\\nThis is represented in Figure 14-1 by the marginal cost curve, which measures the marginal increase in total cost as a result of additional traffic flow.\\nFor a total cost curve total cost  3f 2, the marginal cost is given by taking the derivative d(total cost)df  6f.\\nObserve that the marginal cost curve 6f is higher than the average cost curve 3f.\\nIn other words, the marginal impact of a motorist on total cost is much higher than his or her average share of the impact.\\nIdeally, we should charge motorists a toll for highway use based on this marginal cost that they add to the system.\\nIf we were to do so for our example (i.e., somehow charge 3f as additional toll to raise the total marginal cost to 6f), from our demand curve, we obtain f  1,000  marginal cost  1,000  6f.\\nSolving this equation for f, we obtain an equilibrium traffic of f  1,000/7  143 motorists.\\nMotorists should be charged a toll 3f that depends on the amount of traffic on the highway.\\nIf the traffic is at a level below 143, motorists pay a lower toll.\\nAs traffic increases, the toll rises in proportion and this increase in costs now discourages motorists from joining the highway.\\nAt equilibrium, there are f  143 motorists on the highway, each is charged a congestion-related toll of 3f  3 ?143  429, and each incurs average congestion-related costs of 3f  429 for a total cost of 838 per motorist.\\nWith a toll in place, fewer motorists join the highway because they bear the true cost they are imposing on the highway system.\\nThis toll lowers the vehicle flow rate from Q0  250 to Q1  143 and reduces the average congestion cost per motorist from 750 to 429.\\nIn other words, the absence of a congestion toll results in an overuse of the transportation infrastructure and a higher resulting congestion cost on all users.\\nThe problem is well illustrated by a simple illustration given by Vickrey (see Button and Verhoef, 1998).\\nEach member of a group going out to dinner is likely to order an expensive item if the plan is to share the bill equally at the end instead of having each person pay his or her true charge.\\nThus, it is fair to say that the overall bill is higher if it is shared equally compared to each person paying based on actual consumption.\\nThe same is true with transportation infrastructure if pricing is not linked to congestion.\\nQuasi-market prices for transportation infrastructure thus result in higher prices at peak locations and times and lower prices otherwise.\\nSuch pricing is not commonly observed for transportation infrastructure except for roads in Singapore and city centers in a few European cities.\\nCongestion is a major factor at several ports and airports.\\nThe Los Angeles胎ong Beach port, for example, experienced significant congestion in 2004.\\nSeveral factors affected the congestion, including capacity problems on railroads taking containers away, labor shortages, and technology issues.\\nHowever, congestion was also affected by the desire of many shippers to bring weekly shipments from Asia over the weekend to ensure supply for the entire week.\\nThis created a peak time with significant congestion.\\nThe peak workload also becomes exaggerated as container ships get larger.\\nIn such a situation, the use of peak tolls to level out the arrivals can be an effective policy.\\nOverall, it is important to keep in mind that transportation infrastructure faces congestion-related problems unless users are forced to internalize the marginal impact on society of their actions.\\nIt may be most effective to charge a congestion toll and use the money generated to improve the effectiveness of the transportation infrastructure.\\nKey Point Transportation infrastructures often require government ownership or regulation because of their inherently monopolistic nature.\\nIn the absence of a monopoly, deregulation and market forces help create an effective industry structure.\\nWhen the infrastructure is publicly owned, it is important to price usage to reflect the marginal impact on the cost to society.\\nIf this is not done, overuse and congestion result because the cost borne by a user is less than his or her marginal impact on total cost.\\nThe design of a transportation network affects the performance of a supply chain by establishing the infrastructure within which operational transportation decisions regarding scheduling and routing are made.\\nA well-designed transportation network allows a supply chain to achieve the desired degree of responsiveness at a low cost.\\nThree basic questions need to be considered when designing a transportation network between two stages of a supply chain: 1.\\nShould transportation be direct or through an intermediate site?\\nShould the intermediate site stock product or only serve as a cross-docking location?\\nShould each delivery route supply a single destination or multiple destinations (milk run)?\\nBased on the answers to these questions, the supply chain ends up with a variety of transportation networks.\\nWe discuss these options and their strengths and weaknesses in the context of a buyer with multiple locations sourcing from several suppliers.\\nDirect Shipment Network to Single Destination With the direct shipment network to a single destination option, the buyer structures the transportation network so that all shipments come directly from each supplier to each buyer location, as shown in Figure 14-2.\\nWith a direct shipment network, the routing of each shipment is specified, and the supply chain manager needs to decide only the quantity to ship and the mode of transportation to use.\\nThis decision involves a trade-off between transportation and inventory costs, as discussed later in the chapter.\\nThe major advantage of a direct shipment transportation network is the elimination of intermediate warehouses and its simplicity of operation and coordination.\\nThe shipment decision is completely local, and the decision made for one shipment does not influence others.\\nThe transportation time from supplier to buyer location is short because each shipment goes direct.\\nA direct shipment network to single destination is justified only if demand at buyer locations is large enough that optimal replenishment lot sizes are close to a truckload from each supplier to each location.\\nHome Depot started with a direct shipment network, given that most of the stores it opened until about 2002 were large stores.\\nThe stores ordered in quantities that were large enough that ordering was managed locally within the store and delivery to the store arrived directly from the supplier.\\nThe direct shipment network to single destination, however, proved to be problematic as Home Depot started to open smaller stores that did not have large enough orders to justify a direct shipment.\\nSuppliers  Buyer Locations  .\\nSuppliers  Buyer Locations Suppliers  .\\nDirect Shipping with Milk Runs A milk run is a route on which a truck either delivers product from a single supplier to multiple retailers or goes from multiple suppliers to a single buyer location, as shown in Figure 14-3.\\nIn direct shipping with milk runs, a supplier delivers directly to multiple buyer locations on a truck or a truck picks up deliveries destined for the same buyer location from many suppliers.\\nWhen using this option, a supply chain manager has to decide on the routing of each milk run.\\nDirect shipping provides the benefit of eliminating intermediate warehouses, whereas milk runs lower transportation cost by consolidating shipments to multiple locations on a single truck.\\nMilk runs make sense when the quantity destined for each location is too small to fill a truck but multiple locations are close enough to each other such that their combined quantity fills the truck.\\nCompanies such as Frito-Lay that make direct store deliveries use milk runs to lower their transportation cost.\\nIf frequent small deliveries are needed on a regular basis and either a set of suppliers or a set of retailers is in geographic proximity, the use of milk runs can significantly reduce transportation costs.\\nFor example, Toyota uses milk runs from suppliers to support its just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing system in both Japan and the United States.\\nIn Japan, Toyota has many assembly plants located close together and thus uses milk runs from a single supplier to many plants.\\nIn the United States, however, Toyota uses milk runs from many suppliers to each assembly plant given the large distance between assembly plants.\\nAll Shipments via Intermediate Distribution Center with Storage Under this option, product is shipped from suppliers to a central distribution center where it is stored until needed by buyers when it is shipped to each buyer location, as shown in Figure 14-4.\\nStoring product at an intermediate location is justified if transportation economies require large shipments on the inbound side or shipments on the outbound side cannot be coordinated.\\nIn such a situation, product comes into a DC in large quantities where it is held in inventory and sent to buyer locations in smaller replenishment lots when needed.\\nThe presence of a DC allows a supply chain to achieve economies of scale for inbound transportation to a point close to the final destination, because each supplier sends a large shipment to the DC that contains product for all locations the DC serves.\\nBecause DCs serve locations nearby, the outbound transportation cost is not very large.\\nFor example, W.W. Grainger has its suppliers ship products to one of nine DCs (typically in large quantities), with each DC in turn replenishing stores in its vicinity with the smaller quantities they need.\\nBuyer Locations DC  .\\nIt would be expensive for suppliers to try and serve each store directly.\\nSimilarly, when Home Depot sources from an overseas supplier, the product is held in inventory at the DC because the lot size on the inbound side is much larger than the sum of the lot sizes for the stores served by the DC.\\nAll Shipments via Intermediate Transit Point with Cross-Docking Under this option, suppliers send their shipments to an intermediate transit point (could be a DC) where they are cross-docked and sent to buyer locations without storing them.\\nThe product flow is similar to that shown in Figure 14-4 except that there is no storage at the intermediate facility.\\nWhen a DC cross-docks product, each inbound truck contains product from suppliers for several buyer locations, whereas each outbound truck contains product for a buyer location from several suppliers.\\nMajor benefits of cross-docking are that little inventory needs to be held and product flows faster in the supply chain.\\nCross-docking also saves on handling cost because product does not have to be moved into and out of storage.\\nCross-docking is appropriate when economies of scale in transportation can be achieved on both the inbound and outbound sides and both inbound and outbound shipments can be coordinated.\\nWal-Mart has used cross-docking successfully to decrease inventories in the supply chain without incurring excessive transportation costs.\\nWal-Mart builds many large stores in a geographic area supported by a DC.\\nAs a result, the total lot size to all stores from each supplier fills trucks on the inbound side to achieve economies of scale.\\nOn the outbound side, the sum of the lot sizes from all suppliers to each retail store fills up the truck to achieve economies of scale.\\nAnother good example of the use of a transit point with cross-docking comes from Peapod in the Chicago area.\\nPeapod has a DC in Lake Zurich from which it delivers to its customers using milk runs.\\nThis approach proved effective for customers in the northern and western suburbs of Chicago.\\nPeapod, however, wanted to increase its reach to the city of Chicago and the city of Milwaukee.\\nBoth are far enough from the Lake Zurich DC that a milk run wasted about two hours in transit making no productive deliveries.\\nThese markets were also small enough that they did not justify a local DC.\\nPeapod\\'s response has been to set up a cross-docking facility (which tends to be cheaper than a DC because no storage is involved) at each location.\\nPeapod then sends out all deliveries to the local cross-dock facility in a larger truck and uses smaller trucks for local deliveries.\\nThe use of cross-docking at a transit point has allowed Peapod to increase the reach of the Lake Zurich DC without significantly increasing transportation expense.\\nShipping via DC Using Milk Runs As shown in Figure 14-5, milk runs can be used from a DC if lot sizes to be delivered to each buyer location are small.\\nMilk runs reduce outbound transportation costs by consolidating small shipments.\\nFor example, Seven-Eleven Japan cross-docks deliveries from its fresh-food suppliers at its DCs and sends out milk runs to the retail outlets because the total shipment to a store from all suppliers does not fill a truck.\\nThe use of cross-docking and milk runs allows Seven-Eleven Japan to lower its transportation cost while sending small replenishment lots to each store.\\nThe use of cross-docking with milk runs requires a significant degree of coordination and suitable routing and scheduling.\\nThe online grocer Peapod uses milk runs from DCs when making customer deliveries to help reduce transportation costs for small shipments to be delivered to homes.\\nOshKosh B\\'Gosh, a manufacturer of children\\'s wear, has used this idea to virtually eliminate LTL shipments from its DC in Tennessee to retail stores.\\nTailored Network The tailored network option is a suitable combination of previous options that reduces the cost and improves responsiveness of the supply chain.\\nHere transportation uses a combination of cross-docking, milk runs, and TL and LTL carriers, along with package carriers in some cases.\\nThe goal is to use the appropriate option in each situation.\\nHigh-demand products to highdemand retail outlets may be shipped directly, whereas low-demand products or shipments to low-demand retail outlets are consolidated to and from the DC.\\nThe complexity of managing this transportation network is high because different shipping procedures are used for each product and retail outlet.\\nOperating a tailored network requires significant investment in information infrastructure to facilitate the coordination.\\nSuch a network, however, allows for the selective use of a shipment method to minimize the transportation as well as inventory costs.\\nTable 14-2 summarizes the pros and cons of the various transportation network options discussed.\\nWe illustrate some of these choices in Example 14-1.\\nEXAMPLE 14-1 Selecting a Transportation Network A retail chain has eight stores in a region supplied from four supply sources.\\nTrucks have a capacity of 40,000 units and cost $1,000 per load plus $100 per delivery.\\nThus, a truck making two deliveries charges $1,200.\\nThe cost of holding one unit in inventory at retail for a year is $0.20.\\nTable 14-2 Pros and Cons of Different Transportation Networks  Network Structure  Pros  Cons  Direct shipping Direct shipping with milk runs All shipments via central DC

whether to use direct shipping from suppliers to retail stores or setting up milk runs from suppliers to retail stores.\\nWhat network do you recommend if annual sales for each product at each retail store are 960,000 units?\\nWhat network do you recommend if sales for each product at each retail store are 120,000 units?\\nAnalysis: We provide a detailed analysis when annual sales of each product at each retail store are 960,000 units.\\nOur analysis assumes that all trucks travel full.\\nA more sophisticated analysis can be performed for which the optimal load on each truck is calculated and used in the analysis.\\nWe first analyze the direct shipping network and assume that full truckloads will be shipped from suppliers to retail stores.\\nIn this case, we have the following: Batch size shipped from each supplier to each store  40,000 units Number of shipments  year from each supplier to each store  960,000  40,000  24 Annual trucking cost for direct network  24  1,100 ?4  8  $844,800 Average inventory at each store for each product  40,000  2  20,000 units Annual inventory cost for direct network  20,000  0.2  4 ?8  $128,000 Total annual cost of direct network  $844,800  $128,000  $972,800 Now we analyze the network in which suppliers run milk runs to retail stores.\\nMilk runs increase the transportation cost but decrease the level of inventory each store has to hold.\\nWe provide a detailed analysis for the instance of suppliers running milk runs to two stores on each truck.\\nIn this case, we have the following: Batch size shipped from each supplier to each store  40,000  2  20,000 units Number of shipments  year from each supplier to each store  960,000  20,000  48 Transportation cost per shipment per store (two stores / truck)  1,000  2  100  $600 Annual trucking cost for milk run network  48  600 ?4  8  $921,600 Average inventory at each store for each product  20,000 / 2  10,000 units Annual inventory cost for direct network  10,000  0.2 ?4  8  $64,000 Total annual cost of direct network  $921,600  $64,000  $985,600  .\\nThis analysis shows that when demand per product per store is 960,000 units, the direct network is cheaper than running milk runs with two stores per route.\\nIncreasing the number of stores on a milk run ends up costing even more because it raises transportation costs more than it saves in holding costs.\\nWhen demand per product per store is 120,000, we first provide the detailed costs for the direct shipping network as follows (assuming all trucks travel full): Batch size shipped from each supplier to each store  40,000 units Number of shipments  year from each supplier to each store  120,000  40,000  3 Annual trucking cost for direct network  3  1,100 ?4 ?8  $105,600 Average inventory at each store for each product  40,000  2  20,000 units Annual inventory cost for direct network  20,000  0.2 ?4  8  $128,000 Total annual cost of direct network  $105,600  $128,000  $233,600 For the direct network, it turns out that it is better not to fill each truck but to send only 36,332 units per truck to minimize total annual costs.\\nThe optimal loading increases transportation costs a bit but decreases total costs to $232,524 per year.\\nNow we analyze the network in which suppliers use milk runs to retail stores.\\nWe provide a detailed analysis for the instance of suppliers running milk runs to four stores on each truck and each truck travels full.\\nIn this case, we have the following: Batch size shipped from each supplier to each store  40,000  4  10,000 units Number of shipments  year from each supplier to each store  120,000  10,000  12 Transportation cost per shipment per store (four stores  truck)  1,000  4  100  $350 Annual trucking cost for milk run network  12  350 ?4 ?8  $134,400 Average inventory at each store for each product  10,000  2  5,000 units Annual inventory cost for direct network  5,000  0.2 ?4  8  $32,000 Total annual cost of direct network  $134,400  $32,000  $166,400 This analysis shows that when demand per product per store is 120,000 units, the milk run network with four stores per route is cheaper than the direct network (even when truck loads are optimized).\\nThe direct network ends up costing more because of increased inventory holding costs even though transportation is cheaper.\\nObserve that milk runs become more attractive as the amount flowing through the system decreases.\\nIn the next section, we discuss a variety of trade-offs that supply chain managers need to consider when designing and operating a transportation network.\\nAll transportation decisions made by shippers in a supply chain network need to take into account their impact on inventory costs, facility and processing costs, the cost of coordinating operations, and the level of responsiveness provided to customers.\\nFor example, Amazon\\'s use of package carriers to deliver products to customers increases transportation cost but allows Amazon to centralize its facilities and reduce inventory costs.\\nIf Amazon wants to reduce its transportation costs, the company must either sacrifice responsiveness to customers or increase the number of facilities and resulting inventories to move closer to customers.\\nThe cost of coordinating operations is generally hard to quantify.\\nShippers should evaluate different transportation options in terms of various costs and revenues and then rank them according to coordination complexity.\\nA manager can then make the appropriate transportation decision.\\nManagers must consider the following trade-offs when making transportation decisions: ?Transportation and inventory cost trade-off ?Transportation cost and customer responsiveness trade-off  .\\nTransportation and Inventory Cost Trade-Off The trade-off between transportation and inventory costs is significant when designing a supply chain network.\\nTwo fundamental supply chain decisions involving this trade-off are ?Choice of transportation mode ?Inventory aggregation CHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION MODE Selecting a transportation mode is both a planning and an operational decision in a supply chain.\\nThe decision regarding carriers with which a company contracts is a planning decision, whereas the choice of transportation mode for a particular shipment is an operational decision.\\nFor both decisions, a shipper must balance transportation and inventory costs.\\nThe mode of transportation that results in the lowest transportation cost does not necessarily lower total costs for a supply chain.\\nCheaper modes of transport typically have longer lead times and larger minimum shipment quantities, both of which result in higher levels of inventory in the supply chain.\\nModes that allow for shipping in small quantities lower inventory levels but tend to be more expensive.\\nApple, for example, airfreights several of its products from Asia.\\nThis choice cannot be justified on the basis of transportation cost alone.\\nIt can be justified only because the use of a faster mode of transportation for shipping valuable components allows Apple to carry low levels of inventory and still be responsive to its customers.\\nThe impact of using different modes of transportation on inventories, response time, and costs in the supply chain is shown in Table 14-3.\\nEach transportation mode is ranked along various dimensions, with 1 being the worst and 6 being the best.\\nFaster modes of transportation are preferred for products with a high value-to-weight ratio (an iPad is a good example of such a product) for which reducing inventories is important, whereas cheaper modes are preferred for products with a small value-to-weight ratio (e.g., furniture imported by IKEA) for which reducing transportation cost is important.\\nThe choice of transportation mode should take into account cycle, safety, and in-transit inventory costs besides the cost of transportation.\\nThe purchase price must also be included if it changes with the choice of transportation mode (perhaps because of a change in lot sizes).\\nIgnoring inventory costs when making transportation decisions can result in choices that worsen the performance of a supply chain, as illustrated in Example 14-2.\\nEXAMPLE 14-2 Trade-offs When Selecting Transportation Mode Eastern Electric (EE) is a major appliance manufacturer with a large plant in the Chicago area.\\nEE purchases all the motors for its appliances from Westview Motors, located near Dallas.\\nEE currently purchases 120,000 motors each year from Westview at a price of $120 per motor.\\nTable 14-3 Ranking of Transportation Modes in Terms of Supply Chain Performance (1: Worst, 6: Best)  Mode  Cycle Inventory  Safety Inventory  In-Transit Cost

years and is expected to stay that way.\\nEach motor averages about 10 pounds in weight, and EE has traditionally purchased lots of 3,000 motors.\\nWestview ships each EE order within a day of receiving it (lead time is one day more than transit time).\\nAt its assembly plant, EE carries a safety inventory equal to 50 percent of the average demand for motors during the delivery lead time.\\nThe plant manager at EE has received several proposals for transportation and must decide on the one to accept.\\nThe details of various proposals are provided in Table 14-4, where one cwt is equal to a hundred pounds.\\nGolden\\'s pricing represents a marginal unit quantity discount (see Chapter 11).\\nGolden\\'s representative has proposed lowering the marginal rate for the quantity over 250 cwt in a shipment from $4/cwt to $3/cwt and suggested that EE increase its batch size to 4,000 motors to take advantage of the lower transportation cost.\\nWhat should the plant manager do?\\nAnalysis: Golden\\'s new proposal will result in low transportation costs for EE if the plant manager orders in lots of 4,000 motors.\\nThe plant manager, however, decides to include inventory costs in the transportation decision.\\nEE\\'s annual cost of holding inventory is 25 percent, which implies an annual holding cost of H  $120  0.25  $30 per motor.\\nShipments by rail require a five-day transit time, whereas shipments by truck have a transit time of three days.\\nThe transportation decision affects the cycle inventory, safety inventory, and in-transit inventory for EE.\\nTherefore, the plant manager decides to evaluate the total transportation and inventory cost for each transportation option.\\nThe AM Rail proposal requires a minimum shipment of 20,000 pounds or 2,000 motors.\\nThe replenishment lead time in this case is L  5  1  6 days.\\nFor a lot size of Q  2,000 motors, the plant manager obtains the following: Cycle inventory = Q>2 = 2,000>2 = 1,000 motors Safety inventory = L > 2 days of demand = (6>2)(120,000>365) = 986 motors In-transit inventory = 120,000(5>365) = 1,644 motors Total average inventory = 1,000 + 986 + 1,644 = 3,630 motors Annual holding cost using AM Rail = 3,630 * $30 = $108,900 AM Rail charges $6.50 per cwt, resulting in a transportation cost of $0.65 per motor because each motor weighs 10 pounds.\\nHere we have approximated the holding cost because we have not included the transportation cost in the cost of the product.\\nA more precise evaluation would set the holding cost of in-transit inventory to be $30 (because transportation cost has not yet been incurred) and the holding cost of cycle and safety inventory to be 120.65 ?0.25  $30.16 because transportation cost has been incurred by this stage.\\nThe

an inventory holding cost of 1,644  30  1,986  30.16  $109,218.\\nThe annual transportation is obtained as follows: Annual transportation cost using AM Rail = 120,000 * 0.65 = $78,000 The total annual cost for inventory and transportation using AM Rail is thus $186,900.\\nThe plant manager then evaluates the cost associated with each transportation option as shown in Table 14-5 (we have used the approximate inventory cost in this analysis, applying the holding cost only to the unit cost and not the unit cost plus transportation cost / unit).\\nBased on the analysis in Table 14-5 (the inventory numbers are rounded to the closest integer), the plant manager decides to sign a contract with Golden Freightways and order motors in lots of 500.\\nThis option has the highest transportation cost but the lowest overall cost.\\nIf the selection of the transportation option was made using only the transportation cost incurred, Golden\\'s new proposal lowering the price for large shipments would look attractive.\\nIn reality, EE pays a high overall cost for this proposal because of the high inventory costs that result.\\nThus, considering the trade-off between inventory and transportation costs allows the plant manager to make a transportation decision that minimizes EE\\'s total cost.\\nKey Point When selecting a mode of transportation, managers must account for unit costs and cycle, safety, and in-transit inventory costs that result from using each mode.\\nModes with high transportation cost can be justified if they result in significantly lower inventory costs.\\nINVENTORY AGGREGATION Firms can significantly reduce the safety inventory they require by physically aggregating inventories in one location (see Chapter 12).\\nMost online businesses use this technique to gain advantage over firms with facilities in many locations.\\nFor example, Amazon has focused on decreasing its facility and inventory costs by holding inventory in a few warehouses, whereas booksellers such as Barnes & Noble have to hold inventory in many retail stores.\\nTransportation cost, however, generally increases when inventory is aggregated.\\nIf inventories are highly disaggregated, some aggregation can also lower transportation costs.\\nBeyond a point, however, aggregation of inventories raises total transportation costs.\\nConsider a bookstore chain such as Barnes & Noble.\\nThe inbound transportation cost to Barnes & Noble is due to the  .\\nreplenishment of bookstores with new books.\\nThere is no outbound cost because customers transport their own books home.\\nIf Barnes & Noble decides to close all its bookstores and sell only online, it will have to incur both inbound and outbound transportation costs.\\nThe inbound transportation cost to warehouses will be lower than to all bookstores.\\nOn the outbound side, however, transportation cost will increase significantly because the outbound shipment to each customer will be small and will require an expensive mode such as a package carrier.\\nThe total transportation cost will increase on aggregation because each book travels the same distance as when it was sold through a bookstore, except that a large fraction of the distance is on the outbound side using an expensive mode of transportation.\\nAs the degree of inventory aggregation increases, total transportation cost goes up.\\nAnother comparison is in the video rental business between Netflix and Redbox.\\nNetflix aggregates its inventories, thus lowering facility and inventory expense.\\nIt does, however, have to pay to ship DVDs between its DCs and customer homes.\\nRedbox, in contrast has many vending machines that carry DVDs but incurs low transportation costs.\\nThus, all firms planning inventory aggregation must consider the trade-offs among transportation, inventory, and facility costs when making this decision.\\nInventory aggregation is a good idea when inventory and facility costs form a large fraction of a supply chain\\'s total costs.\\nInventory aggregation is useful for products with a large value-to-weight ratio and for products with high demand uncertainty.\\nFor example, inventory aggregation is valuable for new products in the PC industry, because PCs have a large value-to-weight ratio and demand for new products is uncertain.\\nInventory aggregation is also a good idea if customer orders are large enough to ensure sufficient economies of scale on outbound transportation.\\nWhen products have a low value-to-weight ratio and customer orders are small, however, inventory aggregation may hurt a supply chain\\'s performance because of high transportation costs.\\nCompared to PCs, the value of inventory aggregation is smaller for best-selling books that have a lower value-to-weight ratio and more predictable demand.\\nWe illustrate the trade-off involved in making aggregation decisions in Example 14-3.\\nEXAMPLE 14-3 Tradeoffs When Aggregating Inventory HighMed, a manufacturer of medical equipment used in heart procedures, is located in Madison, Wisconsin, and cardiologists use its products all over North America.\\nThe medical equipment is not sold through purchasing agents but directly to doctors.\\nHighMed currently divides the United States into 24 territories, each with its own sales force.\\nAll product inventories are maintained locally and replenished from Madison every four weeks using UPS.\\nThe average replenishment lead time using UPS is one week.\\nUPS charges at a rate of $0.66  0.26x, where x is the quantity shipped in pounds.\\nThe products sold fall into two categories--Highval and Lowval.\\nHighval products weigh 0.1 pounds and cost $200 each.\\nLowval products weigh 0.04 pounds and cost $30 each.\\nWeekly demand for Highval products in each territory is normally distributed, with a mean of H  2 and a standard deviation of H  5.\\nWeekly demand for Lowval products in each territory is normally distributed, with a mean of L  20 and a standard deviation of L  5.\\nHighMed maintains sufficient safety inventories in each territory to provide a CSL of 0.997 for each product.\\nHolding cost at HighMed is 25 percent.\\nIn addition to the current approach, the management team at HighMed is considering two other options: Option A.\\nKeep the current structure but replenish inventory once a week rather than once every four weeks.\\nEliminate inventories in the territories, aggregate all inventories in a finishedgoods warehouse at Madison, and replenish the warehouse once a week.\\nIf inventories are aggregated at Madison, orders will be shipped using FedEx, which charges $5.53  0.53x per shipment, where x is the quantity shipped in pounds.\\nrequires a one-week lead time to replenish finished-goods inventories at the Madison warehouse.\\nAn average customer order is for 1 unit of HighVal and 10 units of LowVal.\\nWhat should HighMed do?\\nAnalysis: HighMed can reduce transportation cost by aggregating the quantity shipped at a time because prices for both UPS and FedEx display economies of scale.\\nWhen comparing Option A with the current system, the management team must trade off the savings in transportation cost through less frequent replenishment with the savings in inventory cost with more frequent replenishment.\\nWhen considering Option B, the management team must trade off the increase in transportation cost upon aggregation of inventories and the use of a faster but more expensive carrier (FedEx) with the decrease in inventory cost.\\nThe management team first analyzes the current situation.\\nFor each territory, Replenishment lead time, L  1 week Reorder interval, T  4 weeks CSL  0.997 1.\\nHighMed inventory costs (current scenario): For HighVal in each territory, the management team obtains the following: Average lot size, QH = expected demand during T weeks = TmH = 4 * 2 = 8 units Safety inventory, ssH = F-11CSL2 * sT+L = F-11CSL2 * 1T + L * sH = F-110.9972 * 14 + 1 * 5 = 30.7 units 1see Equation 12.182 Total High Val inventory = QH>2 + ssH = 18>22 + 30.7 = 34.7 units Across all 24 territories, HighMed thus carries HighVal inventory of 24  34.7  832.8 units (the true number is 833.3 units if we do not round inventory values to the first decimal).\\nFor LowVal in each territory, the management team obtains the following: Average lot size, QL = expected demand during T weeks = TmL = 4 * 20 = 80 units Safety inventory, ssL = F-11CSL2 * sT+L = F-11CSL2 * 1T + L * sL = F-110.9972 * 14 + 1 * 5 = 30.7 units Total LowVal inventory = QL >2 + ssL = 180/22 + 30.7 = 70.7 units Across all 24 territories, HighMed thus carries LowVal inventory  24  70.7  1696.8 units (the true number is 1697.3 if we do not round safety inventory to the first decimal).\\nThe management team thus obtains the following: Annual inventory holding cost for HighMed = (average HighVal inventory * $200 + average LowVal inventory * $30) * 0.25 = (832.8 * $200 + 1696.8 * $30) * 0.25 = $54,366($54,395 without rounding) 2.\\nHighMed transportation cost (current scenario): The average replenishment order from each territory consists of QH units of HighVal and QL units of LowVal.\\nThus Average weight of each replenishment order = 0.1QH + 0.04QL = 0.1 * 8 + 0.04 * 80 = 4 pounds Shipping cost per replenishment order = $0.66 + 0.26 * 4 = $1.70  .\\nEach territory has 13 replenishment orders per year and there are 24 territories.\\nThus, Annual transportation cost = $1.70 * 13 * 24 = $530 3.\\nHighMed total cost (current scenario): Annual inventory and transportation cost at HighMed  inventory cost  transportation cost  $54,366  $530  $54,896 ($54,926 without rounding).\\nThe HighMed management team evaluates the costs for Option A and Option B similarly, and the results are summarized in Table 14-6.\\nThe results in Table 14-6 are reported without rounding and can be obtained from the associated spreadsheet Table 14-6.\\nFrom Table 14-6, observe that increasing the replenishment frequency under Option A decreases total cost at HighMed.\\nThe increase in transportation costs is much smaller than the decrease in inventory costs resulting from smaller lots.\\nHighMed is able to reduce total cost most by aggregating all inventories and using FedEx for transportation, because the decrease in inventories upon aggregation is larger than the increase in transportation costs.\\nThe value of aggregation is affected by transportation costs, uncertainty of demand, holding cost, and the size of customer orders.\\nIf transportation costs were to double for HighMed, the decentralized Option A becomes cheaper than the centralized Option B (in this setting, Option A costs $32,109 whereas Option B costs $37,402).\\nAs transportation cost increases, it becomes cheaper to decentralize inventories even though inventory costs increase.\\nIf demand uncertainty decreases (e.g., the standard deviation of weekly demand for HighVal decreases from 5 to 2), the decentralized Option A again becomes cheaper than the centralized Option B.\\nAs demand uncertainty decreases, it becomes cheaper to decentralize inventories.\\nIf holding cost decreases (e.g., the holding cost drops to 12.5 percent from 25 percent), the decentralized Option A again becomes cheaper than the centralized Option B.\\nAs product value or holding cost decreases it becomes cheaper to decentralize inventories.\\nIf customer order sizes are small, the increase in transportation cost upon aggregation can be significant, and inventory aggregation may increase total costs.\\nReconsider the case of HighMed, but now each customer order averages 0.5 HighVal and 5 LowVal (half the size considered earlier).\\nThe costs for the current option as well as Option A remain unchanged because HighMed does not pay for outbound transportation and incurs only the cost of transporting replenishment orders under  Table 14-6 HighMed Costs Under Different Network Options  Current Scenario  Option A  Number of stocking locations Reorder interval HighVal cycle inventory HighVal safety inventory HighVal inventory LowVal cycle inventory LowVal safety inventory LowVal inventory Annual inventory cost Shipment type Shipment size Shipment weight Annual transport cost Total annual cost  24 4 weeks 96 units

0.5 lb.\\nOption B, however, becomes more expensive because outbound transportation costs increase with a decrease in customer order size.\\nWith smaller customer orders, the costs under Option B are as follows: Average weight of each customer order = 0.1 * 0.5 + 0.04 * 5 = 0.25 pounds Shipping cost per customer order = $5.53 + 0.53 * 0.25 = $5.66 Number of customer orders per territory per week = 4 Total customer orders per year = 4 * 24 * 52 = 4,992 Annual transportation cost = 4,992 * $5.66 = $28,255 ($28,267 without rounding) Total annual cost = inventory cost + transportation cost = $8,474 + $28,255 = $36,729 ($36,740 without rounding) Thus, with small customer orders, inventory aggregation is no longer the lowest-cost option for HighMed because of the large increase in transportation costs.\\nThe company is better off maintaining inventory in each territory and using Option A, which gives a lower total cost.\\nThe lessons from Example 14-3 (and also Chapter 12) with regard to inventory aggregation are summarized in Table 14-7.\\nKey Point Inventory aggregation decisions must account for inventory and transportation costs.\\nInventory aggregation decreases supply chain costs if the product has a high value-to-weight ratio, high demand uncertainty, low transportation cost, and customer orders are large.\\nIf a product has a low value-to-weight ratio, low demand uncertainty, large transportation cost, or small customer orders, inventory aggregation may increase supply chain costs.\\nTrade-off Between Transportation Cost and Customer Responsiveness The transportation cost a supply chain incurs is closely linked to the degree of responsiveness the supply chain aims to provide.\\nIf a firm has high responsiveness and ships all orders within a day of receipt from the customer, it will have small outbound shipments resulting in a high transportation cost.\\nIf it decreases its responsiveness and aggregates orders over a longer time horizon before shipping them out, it will be able to exploit economies of scale and incur a lower transportation cost because of larger shipments.\\nTemporal aggregation is the process of combining orders across time.\\nTemporal aggregation decreases a firm\\'s responsiveness because of shipping delay but also decreases transportation costs because of economies of scale that result from larger shipments.\\nThus, a firm must consider the trade-off between responsiveness and transportation cost when designing its transportation network, as illustrated in Example 14-4.\\nTable 14-7 Conditions Favoring Aggregation or Disaggregation of Inventory  Aggregate Disaggregate  Transport cost Demand uncertainty Holding cost Customer order size  Low High High Large  High Low Low Small  .\\nEXAMPLE 14-4 Trade-off Between Transportation Cost and Responsiveness Alloy Steel is a steel service center in the Cleveland area.\\nAll orders are shipped to customers using an LTL carrier that charges $100  0.01x, where x is the number of pounds of steel shipped on the truck.\\nCurrently, Alloy Steel ships orders on the day they are received.\\nAllowing for two days in transit, this policy allows Alloy to achieve a response time of two days.\\nDaily demand at Alloy Steel over a two-week period is shown in Table 14-8.\\nThe general manager at Alloy Steel believes that customers do not really value the two-day response time and would be satisfied with a four-day response.\\nWhat are the cost advantages of increasing the response time?\\nAnalysis: As the response time increases, Alloy Steel has the opportunity to aggregate demand over multiple days for shipping.\\nFor a response time of three days, Alloy Steel can aggregate demand over two successive days before shipping.\\nFor a response time of four days, Alloy Steel can aggregate demand over three days before shipping.\\nThe manager evaluates the quantity shipped and transportation costs for different response times over the two-week period, as shown in Table 14-9.\\nFrom Table 14-9, observe that the transportation cost for Alloy Steel decreases as the response time increases.\\nThe benefit of temporal consolidation, however, diminishes rapidly upon increasing the response time.\\nAs the response time increases from two to three days, transportation cost over the two-week window decreases by $700.\\nIncreasing the response time from three to four days reduces the transportation cost by only $200.\\nThus, Alloy Steel may be better off offering a three-day response, because the marginal benefit from further increasing the response time is small.\\nIn general, a limited amount of temporal aggregation can be effective in reducing transportation cost in a supply chain.\\nIn choosing response time, however, firms must trade off the decrease in transportation cost upon temporal aggregation with the loss of revenue because of poorer responsiveness.\\nTemporal consolidation also improves transportation performance because it results in more stable shipments.\\nFor example, in Table 14-9, when Alloy Steel sends daily shipments, the coefficient of variation is 0.44, whereas temporal aggregation across three days (achieved with a four-day response time) has a coefficient of variation of only 0.16.\\nMore stable shipments allow both the shipper and the carrier to better plan operations and improve utilization of their assets.\\nKey Point Temporal aggregation of demand results in a reduction of transportation costs because it entails larger shipments and also reduces the variation in shipment sizes from one shipment to the next.\\nIt does, however, hurt customer response time.\\nThe marginal benefit of temporal aggregation declines as the time window over which aggregation takes place increases.\\nIn the next section, we discuss how transportation networks can be tailored to supply customers with differing needs.\\nTable 14-8 Daily Demand at Alloy Steel over Two-Week Period  Monday

characteristics.\\nMost firms sell a variety of products and serve many different customer segments.\\nFor example, W.W. Grainger sells more than 200,000 MRO supply products to both small contractors and large firms.\\nProducts vary in size and value, and customers vary in the quantity purchased, responsiveness required, uncertainty of the orders, and distance from W.W. Grainger branches and DCs.\\nGiven these differences, a firm such as W.W. Grainger should not design a common transportation network to meet all needs.\\nA firm can meet customer needs at a lower cost by using tailored transportation to provide the appropriate transportation choice based on customer and product characteristics.\\nIn the following sections, we describe various forms of tailored transportation in supply chains.\\nTailored Transportation by Customer Density and Distance Firms must consider customer density and distance from warehouse when designing transportation networks.\\nThe ideal transportation options based on density and distance are shown in Table 14-10.\\nWhen a firm serves a high density of customers close to the DC, it is often best for the firm to own a fleet of trucks that are used with milk runs originating at the DC to supply customers, because this scenario makes good use of the vehicles and provides customer contact.\\nIf customer density is high but distance from the warehouse is large, it does not pay to send milk runs from the warehouse because empty trucks will travel a long distance on the return trip.\\nIn such a situation, it is better to use a public carrier with large trucks to haul the shipments to a cross-dock center close to the customer area, where the shipments are loaded onto smaller trucks that deliver product to customers using milk runs.\\nIn this situation, it may not be ideal for a firm to own its own fleet.\\nAs customer density decreases, use of an LTL carrier or a third party doing milk runs is more economical because the third-party carrier can aggregate shipments across many firms.\\nTable 14-10 Transportation Options Based on Customer Density and Distance  Short Distance  Medium Distance  Long Distance  High density Medium density Low density  Private fleet with milk runs Third-party milk runs Third-party milk runs or LTL carrier  Cross-dock with milk runs LTL carrier LTL or package carrier  Cross-dock with milk runs LTL or package carrier Package carrier  If a firm wants to serve an area with a low density of customers far from the warehouse, even LTL carriers may not be feasible and the use of package carriers may be the best option as long as loads are small.\\nBoise Cascade Office Products, an industrial distributor of office supplies, has designed a transportation network consistent with the suggestion in Table 14-10.\\nCustomer density and distance should also be considered when firms decide on the degree of temporal aggregation (which affects response time) to use when supplying customers.\\nFirms should serve areas with high customer density more frequently because these areas are likely to provide sufficient economies of scale in transportation, making temporal aggregation less valuable.\\nTo lower transportation costs, firms should use a higher degree of temporal aggregation and aim for somewhat lower responsiveness when serving areas with a low customer density.\\nTailored Transportation by Size of Customer Firms must consider customer size and location when designing transportation networks.\\nLarge customers can be supplied using a TL carrier, whereas smaller customers will require an LTL carrier or milk runs.\\nWhen using milk runs, a shipper incurs two types of costs: ?Transportation cost based on total route distance ?Delivery cost based on number of deliveries The transportation cost is the same whether going to a large or small customer.\\nIf a delivery is to be made to a large customer, including other small customers on the same truck can save on transportation cost.\\nFor each small customer, however, the delivery cost per unit is higher than for large customers.\\nThus, it is not optimal to deliver to small and large customers with the same frequency at the same price.\\nOne option firms have is to charge a higher delivery cost for smaller customers.\\nAnother option is to tailor milk runs so that they visit larger customers with a higher frequency than smaller customers.\\nFirms can partition customers into large (L), medium (M), and small (S) based on the demand at each.\\nThe optimal frequency of visits can be evaluated based on the transportation and delivery costs (see Section 11.2).\\nIf large customers are to be visited every milk run, medium customers every other milk run, and low-demand customers every third milk run, suitable milk runs can be designed by combining large, medium, and small customers on each run.\\nMedium customers would be partitioned into two subsets (M1, M2), and small customers would be partitioned into three subsets (S1, S2, S3).\\nThe firm can sequence the following six milk runs to ensure that each customer is visited with the appropriate frequency: (L, M1, S1), (L, M2, S2), (L, M1, S3), (L, M2, S1), (L, M1, S2), (L, M2, S3).\\nThis tailored sequence has the advantage that each truck carries about the same load and larger customers are provided more frequent delivery than smaller customers, consistent with their relative costs of delivery.\\nTailored Transportation by Product Demand and Value The degree of inventory aggregation and the modes of transportation used in a supply chain network should vary with the demand and value of a product, as shown in Table 14-11.\\nThe cycle inventory for high-value products with high demand is disaggregated to save on transportation costs because this allows replenishment orders to be transported less expensively.\\nTable 14-11 Aggregation Strategies Based on Value/Demand  Product Type High Value  Low Value  High demand Low demand  Disaggregate cycle inventory.\\nAggregate safety inventory.\\nInexpensive mode of transportation for replenishing cycle inventory and fast mode when using safety inventory.\\nAggregate all inventories.\\nIf needed, use fast mode of transportation for filling customer orders.\\nDisaggregate all inventories and use inexpensive mode of transportation for replenishment.\\nAggregate only safety inventory.\\nUse inexpensive mode of transportation for replenishing cycle inventory.\\ninventory for such products can be aggregated to reduce inventories (see Chapter 12), and a fast mode of transportation can be used if the safety inventory is required to meet customer demand.\\nFor high-demand products with low value, all inventories should be disaggregated and held close to the customer to reduce transportation costs.\\nFor low-demand, high-value products, all inventories should be aggregated to save on inventory costs.\\nFor low-demand, low-value products, cycle inventories can be held close to the customer and safety inventories aggregated to reduce transportation costs while taking some advantage of aggregation.\\nCycle inventories are replenished using an inexpensive mode of transportation to save costs.\\nKey Point Tailoring transportation based on customer density and distance, customer size, or product demand and value allows a supply chain to achieve appropriate responsiveness and low cost.\\nThe complexity and scale of transportation makes it an excellent area within the supply chain for the use of IT systems.\\nThe use of software to determine transportation routes has been the most common IT application in transportation.\\nThis software takes the location of customers, shipment size, desired delivery times, information on the transportation infrastructure (such as distances between points), and vehicle capacity as inputs.\\nThese inputs are formulated into an optimization problem whose solution is a set of routings and a packing list for each vehicle that minimize costs while meeting delivery constraints.\\nAlong with routing, vehicle load optimization software helps improve fleet utilization.\\nBy accounting for the size of the container and the size and sequence of each delivery, this software develops a plan to pack the vehicle efficiently while allowing for the greatest ease of unloading and/or loading along the route.\\nSynchronization between the packing and routing software is important because how much is packed on a truck affects the routing, while the routing obviously affects what is packed on a truck.\\nIT also comes into play in the use of global positioning systems (GPS) for tracking realtime location of vehicles and electronic notification of impending arrivals.\\nThe availability of current information also allows for real-time dynamic optimization of transportation routes and deliveries.\\nElectronic notifications and tracking improve customer service and preparedness throughout the supply chain.\\nThe Internet has also been used by companies such as Freightzone and Echo Global Logistics to help match shipper loads with available capacity with carriers in the trucking industry.\\nThe most common problems in the use of IT in transportation relate to cross-enterprise collaboration and the narrow view taken by some transportation software.\\nGiven that transportation  .\\nis often outsourced, successful collaboration in transportation requires three or more firms to work together, making it much more difficult.\\nOther problems arise because much of the transportation software is focused on efficient routings.\\nThe software often overlooks other factors such as customer service and promised delivery times, which should constrain the route selected.\\nIT in transportation has been around for the longest and has the largest number of vendors in supply chain software.\\nThere has also been a large amount of in-house development that has focused on transportation management.\\nThere are three main types of risk to consider when transporting a shipment between two nodes on the network: 1.\\nThe risk that the shipment is delayed 2.\\nThe risk that the shipment does not reach its destination because intermediate nodes or links are disrupted by external forces 3.\\nThe risk of hazardous material In each case, it is important to identify the sources of risk and their consequences and plan suitable mitigation strategies.\\nDelay arises either because of congestion along links such as roads or nodes such as ports and airports.\\nWhen congestion is the cause of delay, mitigation strategies for the shipper include moving inventories closer to the destination, using alternative lanes, and building a buffer into the lead time.\\nCongestion delays can be mitigated by designing a network with multiple routes to the destination and changing routes in real time based on congestion.\\nCongestion delays can also be mitigated through the use of congestion pricing by the owner of the transportation node or link.\\nDelay may also arise because of the limited availability of transportation or infrastructure capacity.\\nSuch delays are more likely when the assets are owned by a third party that is serving multiple customers.\\nThese delays may be mitigated by owning some transportation capacity or by signing long-term contracts for transportation capacity with the third party.\\nGiven the high cost of owning these assets, it is best to do so for parts of the network where utilization is high.\\nDisruption at transportation links or nodes may occur because of natural events such as hurricanes or human-made events such as terrorism.\\nThe best mitigation strategy in this case is to design alternative routings into the transportation network.\\nFor example, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted the flow of product in many supply chains.\\nAs a result of the earthquake, Toyota announced the delay of two new additions to the Prius line, a wagon and a minivan.\\nCompanies such as UPS and FedEx helped clients design alternative routes if there were other factories they could move production to.\\nSimilarly, during the California dockworkers\\' strike in 2002, many companies arranged for alternative ports to bring in product.\\nWhen considering both delay and disruption risk, it is important to identify sources that are likely to be correlated across the network.\\nFor example, the events on September 11, 2001, caused a disruption in air transportation across the entire United States.\\nAlternative routings were useless as mitigation strategies in this case because no alternative route was available.\\nFor such correlated sources of risk, the only option is to decrease the probability of such a disruption.\\nHazardous material can be harmful when people and the environment are exposed.\\nThe goal of risk mitigation here is to minimize the probability of exposure, and in the event of exposure, to minimize the impact.\\nMitigation strategies include using modified containers and low-risk transportation modes, selecting routes with low accident probability or reduced population and environmental exposure, and modifying the physical or chemical properties of the material being transported to make it less dangerous.\\nAlign transportation strategy with competitive strategy.\\nManagers should ensure that a firm\\'s transportation strategy supports its competitive strategy.\\nThey should design functional incentives that help achieve this goal.\\nHistorically, the transportation function within firms has been evaluated based on the extent to which it can lower transportation costs.\\nSuch a focus leads to decisions that lower transportation costs but hurt the level of responsiveness provided to customers and may raise the firm\\'s total cost.\\nIf the dispatcher at a DC is evaluated based solely on the extent to which trucks are loaded, he or she is likely to delay shipments and hurt customer responsiveness to achieve a larger load.\\nFirms should evaluate the transportation function based on total cost and the level of responsiveness achieved with customers.\\nConsider both in-house and outsourced transportation.\\nManagers should consider an appropriate combination of company-owned and outsourced transportation to meet their needs.\\nThis decision should be based on a firm\\'s ability to handle transportation profitably as well as the strategic importance of transportation to the success of the firm.\\nIn general, outsourcing is a better option when shipment sizes are small, whereas owning the transportation fleet is better when shipment sizes are large and responsiveness is important.\\nFor example, Wal-Mart uses responsive transportation to reduce inventories in its supply chain.\\nGiven the importance of transportation to the success of its strategy, it owns and manages its transportation fleet itself.\\nThis is made easier by the fact that it achieves good utilization from its transportation assets because most of its shipments are large.\\nIn contrast, firms such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr send small shipments to customers; inventory management rather than transportation is the key to their success.\\nA third-party carrier can lower costs for them by aggregating their shipments with those of other companies.\\nAs a result, both companies use third-party carriers for their transportation.\\nUse technology to improve transportation performance.\\nManagers must use information technology to decrease costs and improve responsiveness in their transportation networks.\\nSoftware helps managers do transportation planning and modal selection and build delivery routes and schedules.\\nReal-time tracking allows carriers to communicate with each vehicle and identify its precise location and contents.\\nThese technologies help carriers lower costs and become more responsive to changes.\\nDesign flexibility into the transportation network.\\nWhen designing transportation networks, managers should take into account uncertainty in demand as well as availability of transportation.\\nIgnoring uncertainty encourages a greater use of inexpensive and inflexible transportation modes that perform well when everything goes as planned.\\nSuch networks, however, perform poorly when plans change.\\nWhen managers account for uncertainty, they are more likely to include flexible, though more expensive, modes of transportation within their network.\\nAlthough these modes may be more expensive for a particular shipment, including them in the transportation options allows a firm to reduce the overall cost of providing a high level of responsiveness.\\nUnderstand the role of transportation in a supply chain.\\nTransportation refers to the movement of product from one location to another within a supply chain.\\nThe importance of transportation has grown with the increasing globalization in supply chains and the growth in online sales because both trends increase the distance products travel.\\nTransportation decisions impact supply chain profitability and influence both inventory and facility decisions within a supply chain.\\nEvaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different modes of transportation.\\nThe various modes of transportation include water, rail, intermodal, truck, air, pipeline, and package carriers.\\nWater is typically the least expensive mode but is also the slowest, whereas air and  .\\npackage carriers are the most expensive and the fastest.\\nRail and water are best suited for low-value, large shipments that do not need to be moved in a hurry.\\nAir and package carriers are best suited for small, high-value, emergency shipments.\\nIntermodal and TL carriers are faster than rail and water but somewhat more expensive.\\nLTL carriers are best suited for small shipments that are too large for package carriers but much smaller than a TL.\\nDiscuss the role of infrastructure and policies in transportation.\\nInfrastructure such as ports, roads, and airports has a significant impact on transportation.\\nGiven its inherent monopolistic nature, most transportation infrastructure requires public ownership or regulation.\\nIn the case of public ownership, pricing based on average cost leads to overutilization and congestion.\\nIt is important to use some form of congestion pricing under which users are forced to internalize the increase in network cost they cause.\\nIdentify the relative strengths and weaknesses of various transportation network design options.\\nNetworks are designed to either ship directly from origin to destination or move the product through a consolidation point.\\nDirect shipments are most effective when large quantities are to be moved.\\nWhen shipments are small, use of an intermediate warehouse or DC lowers transportation cost by aggregating smaller shipments even though it takes longer and is more complex.\\nShipments may also be consolidated with milk runs either picking up from multiple locations or dropping off in multiple locations.\\nIdentify trade-offs that shippers need to consider when designing a transportation network.\\nWhen designing transportation networks, shippers need to consider the trade-offs among transportation cost, inventory cost, operating cost, and customer responsiveness.\\nThe supply chain goal is to minimize the total cost while providing the desired level of responsiveness to customers.\\n Understand the role of sourcing in a supply chain.\\nDiscuss factors that affect the decision to outsource a supply chain function.\\nIdentify dimensions of supplier performance that affect total cost.\\nStructure successful auctions and negotiations.\\nDescribe the impact of risk sharing on supplier performance and information distortion.\\nDesign a tailored supplier portfolio.\\nIn this chapter, we explore various factors that influence decisions about whether a supply chain activity is performed within the firm or outsourced.\\nWe also discuss performance characteristics of suppliers that affect total cost.\\nOur goal is to enable managers to consider all the trade-offs involved when making sourcing decisions to maximize value extracted from every stage of a sourcing relationship.\\nUntil 2005, Dell was credited with improving profits by keeping the retail function in-house and selling directly to customers.\\nSince 2007, however, Dell has started to outsource retailing to firms such as Wal-Mart.\\nhas also increased the fraction of assembly that it outsources to contract manufacturers.\\nWhy was vertical integration into retailing a good idea for Dell until about 2005 but not after 2007?\\nWas Dell right in outsourcing a greater fraction of assembly to contract manufacturers?\\nIn contrast to Dell, Apple has significantly expanded the insourcing of retailing during the same period by growing Apple retail stores.\\nProcter & Gamble (P&G) has never attempted to sell detergent directly to customers, and nobody is calling on it to bring the retail function in-house.\\nWhat made vertical integration into retailing a good idea for Dell but a bad idea for P&G?\\nMotorola uses a distributor for the sale of its cell phones in most of Latin America.\\nIn contrast, most of its sales in the United States do not go through distributors.\\nWhy is the outsourcing of distribution for Motorola beneficial in Latin America but not in the United States?\\nIt is important to clarify the distinction between outsourcing and offshoring before we proceed.\\nA firm offshores a supply chain function if it moves the production facility offshore (even if it maintains ownership).\\nIn contrast, a firm outsources if the firm hires an outside firm to perform an operation rather than executing the operation within the firm.\\nThe offshoring decision has been discussed in detail in Chapter 6.\\nIn this chapter, our focus is on the issue of outsourcing rather than offshoring.\\nWe address the outsourcing of supply chain activities by a firm based on the following three questions: 1.\\nWill the third party increase the supply chain surplus relative to performing the activity in-house?\\nHow much of the increase in surplus does the firm get to keep?\\nTo what extent do risks grow upon outsourcing?\\nRecall that the supply chain surplus is the difference between the value of a product for the customer and the total cost of all supply chain activities involved in bringing the product to the customer.\\nThe supply chain surplus is the total size of the pie that all supply chain participants (including the customer) get to share.\\nOur basic premise is that outsourcing makes sense if it increases the supply chain surplus (assuming we get to keep some of the increase) without significantly affecting risks.\\nWe go further and claim that a supply chain participant can survive in the long term only if its presence increases the supply chain surplus.\\nOne can then argue that each party\\'s profit in a supply chain is correlated with the extent to which it increases the surplus.\\nOnce a decision to outsource has been made, sourcing processes include the selection of suppliers, design of supplier contracts, product design collaboration, procurement of material or services, and evaluation of supplier performance, as shown in Figure 15-1.\\nSupplier scoring and assessment is the process used to rate supplier performance.\\nSuppliers should be compared based on their impact on the supply chain surplus and total cost.\\nUnfortunately, sourcing decisions are often driven based solely on the price charged by a supplier.\\nMany other supplier characteristics, such as lead time, reliability, quality, and design capability also affect the total cost of doing business with a supplier.\\nA good supplier scoring and assessment process must identify and track performance along all dimensions and evaluate the impact on the total cost of using a supplier.\\nSupplier selection uses the output from supplier scoring and assessment to identify the appropriate supplier(s).\\nA supply contract is then negotiated with the supplier.\\nA good contract should account for all factors that affect supply chain performance and should be designed to increase supply chain profits in a way that benefits both the supplier and the buyer.\\nSupplier  Supplier  Selection  Scoring  and  and Assessment Contract  Negotiation  Design Collaboration  Procurement  Sourcing Planning and Analysis  .\\nGiven that about 80 percent of the cost of a product is determined during design, it is crucial that suppliers be actively involved at this stage.\\nDesign collaboration allows the supplier and the manufacturer to work together when designing components for the final product.\\nDesign collaboration also ensures that any design changes are communicated effectively to all parties involved with designing and manufacturing the product.\\nOnce the product has been designed, procurement is the process whereby the supplier sends product in response to orders placed by the buyer.\\nThe goal of procurement is to enable orders to be placed and delivered on schedule at the lowest possible overall cost.\\nFinally, the role of sourcing planning and analysis is to analyze spending across various suppliers and component categories to identify opportunities for decreasing the total cost.\\nCost of goods sold (COGS) represents well over 50 percent of sales for most major manufacturers.\\nWithin COGS, purchased parts are now a much higher fraction than they were several decades ago.\\nThis change has occurred because companies have reduced vertical integration and outsourced the manufacture of many components.\\nCompanies such as Cisco have gone further and also outsourced a significant fraction of the assembly capacity.\\nAs there is greater pressure on firms to achieve lower costs and the suppliers\\' share of the COGS grows, good sourcing decisions will have greater impact on the cost leadership and competitive advantage enjoyed by a firm.\\nEffective sourcing processes within a firm can improve profits for the firm and total supply chain surplus in a variety of ways.\\nIt is important that the drivers of improved profits be clearly identified when making sourcing decisions.\\nSome of the benefits from effective sourcing decisions follow: ?Better economies of scale can be achieved if orders within a firm are aggregated.\\n?More efficient procurement transactions can significantly reduce the overall cost of purchasing.\\nThis is most important for items for which a large number of low-value transactions occur.\\n?Design collaboration can result in products that are easier to manufacture and distribute, resulting in lower overall costs.\\nThis factor is most important for components that contribute a significant amount to product cost and value.\\n?Good procurement processes can facilitate coordination with the supplier and improve forecasting and planning.\\nBetter coordination lowers inventories and improves the matching of supply and demand.\\n?Appropriate supplier contracts can allow for the sharing of risk, resulting in higher profits for both the supplier and the buyer.\\n?Firms can achieve a lower purchase price by increasing competition through the use of auctions.\\nWhen designing a sourcing strategy, it is important for a firm to be clear on the factors that have the greatest influence on performance and target improvement on those areas.\\nFor example, if most of the spending for a firm is on materials with only a few high-value transactions, improving the efficiency of procurement transactions will provide little value, whereas improving design collaboration and coordination with the supplier will provide significant value.\\nIn contrast, when sourcing items with many low-value transactions, increasing the efficiency of procurement transactions will be valuable.\\nIn the next section, we discuss factors that influence the outsourcing decision.\\nThe decision to outsource is based on the growth in supply chain surplus provided by the third party and the increase in risk incurred by using a third party.\\nA firm should consider outsourcing if the growth in surplus is large with a small increase in risk.\\nPerforming the function in-house is preferable if the growth in surplus is small or the increase in risk is large.\\nHow Do Third Parties Increase the Supply Chain Surplus?\\nThird parties increase the supply chain surplus if they either increase value for the customer or decrease the supply chain cost relative to a firm performing the task in-house.\\nThird parties can increase the supply chain surplus effectively if they are able to aggregate supply chain assets or flows to a higher level than a firm itself can.\\nWe discuss various mechanisms that third parties can use to grow the surplus.\\nCapacity aggregation.\\nA third party can increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating demand across multiple firms and gaining production economies of scale that no single firm can on its own.\\nThis is the most common reason for outsourcing production in a supply chain.\\nOne of the reasons that Dell (and every other PC manufacturer) outsources design and production of the processors in its PCs to Intel is that Intel supplies many computer manufacturers and gains economies of scale that are not available to Dell if it designs and produces its own processors.\\nThe growth in surplus from outsourcing is highest when the needs of the firm are significantly lower than the volumes required to gain economies of scale.\\nA good example in this context is Magna Steyr, a third party that has taken over assembly of automobiles for several manufacturers.\\nMagna Steyr has developed flexible capacity and labor that allows it to produce economically cars that sell in low volumes.\\nIt has produced the X3 for BMW, the G class for Mercedes, and the Grand Cherokee for Chrysler.\\nIn each case, the models had relatively low demand volume.\\nEach firm would not have gained sufficient economies of scale for assembling its model.\\nThere is a cost to this flexibility that cannot be justified based on one model, but Magna Steyr gains economies of scale by serving many auto firms.\\nA third party is unlikely to increase the surplus through capacity aggregation if the volume requirements of a firm are large and stable.\\nThis is substantiated by the fact that no auto manufacturer outsources production of its best-selling cars to a third party.\\nInventory aggregation.\\nA third party can increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating inventories across a large number of customers.\\nW.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr are MRO suppliers that provide value primarily by aggregating inventory for hundreds of thousands of customers.\\nAggregation allows them to significantly lower overall uncertainty and improve economies of scale in purchasing and transportation.\\nAs a result, these MRO distributors carry significantly less safety and cycle inventory than would be required if each customer decided to carry inventory on its own.\\nAnother example of inventory aggregation is provided by Brightstar, a distributor that facilitates postponement for cell phones.\\nThese phones are manufactured in the Far East and shipped to the Brightstar warehouse in Miami, where software and accessories are added as customer orders arrive from South America.\\nHigh product variety and many small customers allow Brightstar to increase the supply chain surplus through inventory aggregation and postponement.\\nThe third party performing inventory aggregation adds most to the supply chain surplus when demand from customers is fragmented and uncertain.\\nWhen demand is large and predictable, an intermediary adds little to the surplus by holding inventory.\\nThe consolidation of retailing and the resulting scale and predictability of demand for retailers explain why distributors play a much smaller role in the United States compared to developing countries.\\nTransportation aggregation by transportation intermediaries.\\nA third party may increase the surplus by aggregating the transportation function to a higher level than any shipper can on its own.\\nUPS, FedEx, and a host of LTL carriers are examples of transportation intermediaries that increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating transportation across a variety of shippers.\\nThe value provided in each case is driven by the inherent economies of scale in transportation.\\nEach shipper wants to send less than the capacity of the transportation mode.\\nThe transportation intermediary aggregates shipments across multiple shippers, thus lowering the cost of each shipment below what could be achieved by the shipper alone.\\nA transportation intermediary increases the supply chain surplus when shippers are sending packages or LTL quantities to customers that are geographically distributed.\\nA transportation intermediary can also grow the surplus for TL shipping by aggregating across multiple firms having unbalanced  .\\ntransportation flows, with the quantity coming into a region very different from the quantity leaving the region.\\nAn excellent example of a transportation intermediary increasing the supply chain surplus is provided by a pilot program involving Chrysler and Ford.\\nExel, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, operated a dedicated fleet for the distribution of spare parts for Chrysler.\\nIn tests in Michigan and Mexico, Ford added its own truck parts for delivery on the same fleet.\\nGiven the relatively low density of dealers in Northern Michigan and Mexico (outside Mexico City), the aggregation provided by Exel was a benefit for both Ford and Chrysler.\\nA transportation intermediary is likely to add the least to the supply chain surplus for a company such as Wal-Mart, for which shipment sizes are large and the company also achieves aggregation across the many retail stores that it owns.\\nThe only possibility for a transportation intermediary in such a setting would be to obtain better backhauls than Wal-Mart.\\nTransportation aggregation by storage intermediaries.\\nA third party that stores inventory can also increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating inbound and outbound transportation.\\nStorage intermediaries such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr stock products from more than a thousand manufacturers each and sell to hundreds of thousands of customers.\\nOn the inbound side, they are able to aggregate shipments from several manufacturers onto a single truck.\\nThis results in a lower transportation cost than could be achieved by each manufacturer independently.\\nOn the outbound side, they aggregate packages for customers at a common destination, resulting in a significantly lower transportation cost than can be achieved by each customer separately.\\nFor example, the Chicago distribution center for Grainger fills separate trucks with packages destined for each adjacent state.\\nAs soon as a truck destined for Michigan (for instance) is filled, it is sent to the UPS sorting facility in Michigan.\\nThis level of aggregation cannot be achieved by customers on their own.\\nThus, the storage of goods by Grainger and McMaster-Carr increases the supply chain surplus by aggregating inbound and outbound transportation.\\nA similar service is provided by distributors in countries such as India.\\nGiven the small size of retail outlets, a distributor aggregates delivery for several manufacturers, significantly lowering the outbound transportation cost.\\nThis form of aggregation is most effective if the intermediary stocks products from many suppliers and serves many customers, each ordering in small quantities.\\nThis form of aggregation becomes less effective as the scale of shipment from a supplier to customer grows.\\nThis is seen in the decreased use of distributors by U.S. supermarket chains.\\nThe supermarkets typically get full trucks delivered on their own and do not need a distributor for further aggregation.\\nWarehousing aggregation.\\nA third party may increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating warehousing needs over several customers.\\nThe growth in surplus is achieved in terms of lower real estate costs and lower processing costs within the warehouse.\\nSavings through warehousing aggregation arise if a supplier\\'s warehousing needs are small or if its needs fluctuate over time.\\nIn either case, the intermediary with the warehouse can exploit economies of scale in warehouse construction and operation by aggregating across multiple customers.\\nAn example is Safexpress, a third-party logistics provider in India.\\nSafexpress owns warehouses distributed throughout the country that are used by many of its customers.\\nMost of its customers do not have warehousing needs that are large enough to justify a warehouse of their own in each region.\\nWarehousing aggregation by an intermediary adds a lot to the surplus for small suppliers and for companies that are starting out in a geographic location.\\nWarehousing aggregation is unlikely to add much to the surplus for a large supplier or customer whose warehousing needs are large and relatively stable over time.\\nThe warehousing needs of Wal-Mart, Amazon, and Grainger are sufficiently large and stable to justify their own warehouse, and a third party is unlikely to increase the surplus.\\nProcurement aggregation.\\nA third party increases the supply chain surplus if it aggregates procurement for many small players and facilitates economies of scale in ordering, production, and inbound transportation.\\nProcurement aggregation is most effective across many small buyers.\\nA good example is FleetXchange, a firm that offers small truck fleets lower prices for truck equipment and services through aggregate buying.\\nProcurement aggregation is not likely to be a big factor with a few large customers.\\nFor example, contract manufacturers in the  .\\nelectronics industry have not convinced their large customers, such as HP and Motorola, to outsource the procurement function.\\nBoth HP and Motorola are large enough that little marginal benefit can be expected from further aggregation, whereas there is a potential downside in that they would cede the relationship with the supplier to the contract manufacturer if they outsourced procurement.\\nFor a small electronics company, however, the procurement aggregation offered by a contract manufacturer could add significantly to the supply chain surplus.\\nInformation aggregation.\\nA third party may increase the surplus by aggregating information to a higher level than can be achieved by a firm performing the function in-house.\\nAll retailers aggregate information on products from many manufacturers in a single location.\\nThis information aggregation reduces search costs for customers.\\neBags is an example of a retailer that primarily provides information aggregation.\\neBags holds little inventory but is a single point of display for information on bags from many manufacturers.\\nBy aggregating product information, eBags significantly reduces search costs for the online customer.\\nRelative to eBags, if each manufacturer set up its own Web site and online store, search costs for the customer would be higher, and each manufacturer would have to invest in the information infrastructure.\\nThus, eBags increases the supply chain surplus through information aggregation by making search cheaper and reducing investment in information technology.\\nTwo other examples of companies using information aggregation are W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr.\\nBoth provide a product catalog and a detailed Web site.\\nThis simplifies search by the customer and aggregates product information for more than a thousand manufacturers.\\nAnother excellent example of information aggregation is provided by the various online sites, such as Freight Zone and Echo Global Logistics, that bring together shippers and truckers looking for shipments.\\nInformation aggregation reduces search costs and allows better matching of truckers and shipments.\\nInformation aggregation increases the surplus if both buyers and sellers are fragmented and buying is sporadic.\\nInformation aggregation is not likely to be a big factor for a car manufacturer that regularly buys steel from a single supplier.\\nReceivables aggregation.\\nA third party may increase the supply chain surplus if it can aggregate the receivables risk to a higher level than the firm or it has a lower collection cost than the firm.\\nBrightstar is a distributor for Motorola in most Latin American countries other than Brazil.\\nCell phones in the area are sold through many small, independently owned retail outlets.\\nCollecting receivables from each retail outlet is an expensive proposition for a manufacturer.\\nGiven that a retailer buys from many manufacturers, the power of each manufacturer to collect is also reduced.\\nBrightstar, as a distributor, is able to aggregate collection across all manufacturers (that it serves), reducing the collection cost.\\nBy aggregating collection to a greater extent than any one manufacturer can, Brightstar also lowers the default risk.\\nReduced collection cost and risk allow Brightstar to increase the supply chain surplus relative to having this activity performed by manufacturers.\\nThe same is true with distributors in India that often distribute for a large number of manufacturers to the same retailer.\\nGiven their ability to aggregate across many manufacturers and small retailers, distributors in India typically take responsibility for managing receivables from the retailers.\\nReceivables aggregation is likely to increase the supply chain surplus if retail outlets are small and numerous and each outlet stocks products from many manufacturers that are all served by the same distributor.\\nSuch a scenario is more likely in developing countries where retailing is fragmented.\\nIt is less likely in developed countries such as the United States and most of Western Europe, where retailing is consolidated.\\nRelationship aggregation.\\nAn intermediary can increase the supply chain surplus by decreasing the number of relationships required between multiple buyers and sellers.\\nWithout an intermediary, connecting a thousand sellers to a million buyers requires a billion relationships.\\nThe presence of an intermediary lowers the number of relationships required to just over a million.\\nMost retailers and MRO distributors such as W.W. Grainger improve supply chain surplus through relationship aggregation.\\nRelationship aggregation increases the supply chain surplus by increasing the size of each transaction and decreasing their number.\\nRelationship aggregation is most effective when many buyers sporadically purchase small amounts at a time,  .\\nbut each order often has products from multiple suppliers.\\nThus, Grainger can increase the surplus by being a relationship aggregator for MRO products.\\nA third party, however, does not increase the surplus by being a relationship aggregator between a few buyers and sellers for which the relationships are longer term and large.\\nFor example, Covisint has failed to become a relationship aggregator in the automotive industry, especially for direct materials.\\nLower costs and higher quality.\\nA third party can increase the supply chain surplus if it provides lower cost or higher quality relative to the firm.\\nIf these benefits come from specialization and learning, they are likely to be sustainable over the longer term.\\nA specialized third party that is further along the learning curve for some supply chain activity is likely to maintain its advantage over the long term.\\nA common scenario, however, is one in which the third party has a low-cost location that the firm does not.\\nIn such a situation, lower labor and overhead costs are temporary reasons for outsourcing, because if the wage differential is persistent and the third party offers none of the other advantages discussed earlier, it is best for the firm to maintain ownership and offshore production to the low-cost location.\\nKey Point A third party may be able to provide a sustainable growth of the surplus by aggregating to a higher level than the firm itself.\\nThe growth in surplus comes from aggregating capacity, inventory, inbound or outbound transportation, warehousing, procurement, information, receivables, or relationships to a level that the firm cannot on its own.\\nA growth in surplus may also occur if the third party has lower costs or higher quality because of specialization or learning.\\nFactors Influencing Growth of Surplus by a Third Party Three important factors affect the increase in surplus that a third party provides: scale, uncertainty, and the specificity of assets.\\nIf the scale is large, it is likely that sufficient economies of scale are achieved internal to the firm itself.\\nIn this case, it is unlikely that a third party can achieve further scale economies and increase the surplus.\\nWal-Mart has sufficient scale in terms of its transportation needs that it achieves economies of scale on trucking by itself.\\nGoing to a third party would not increase the surplus and would result in some loss of control.\\nIn contrast, if a firm\\'s needs do not provide sufficient economies of scale, the third party can increase the surplus by a large amount.\\nEven though Grainger has a large number of outbound packages, given their geographical dispersion, it would not be able to achieve economies of scale for door-to-door delivery.\\nA third-party package carrier adds to the surplus in this case.\\nThe second important factor is the uncertainty of a firm\\'s needs.\\nIf the needs are predictable, the increase in surplus from a third party is limited, especially if the firm has sufficient scale.\\nIn contrast, if the firm\\'s needs are highly variable over time, the third party can increase the surplus through aggregation with other customers.\\nFor example, Grainger has predictable needs in terms of warehouse space required.\\nGiven sufficient scale, it owns and operates its own distribution centers.\\nIn contrast, most firms have very uncertain demand for MRO products.\\nThey prefer not to hold these items in stock and use Grainger as an intermediary.\\nFinally, the growth in surplus is influenced by the specificity of assets required by the third party.\\nIf the assets required are specific to a firm and cannot be used for others, a third party is unlikely to increase the surplus because all it does is move the assets from one firm to another.\\nThe third party has no opportunity to aggregate across other customers.\\nFor example, if a distributor holds inventory that is specific to a customer, the distributor is unable to aggregate it to a higher level than the customer.\\nThe presence of the distributor does not increase the surplus in this case.\\nSimilarly, if a third-party logistics provider manages a warehouse exclusively for a single firm, it has few opportunities to increase the surplus unless it can aggregate the use of management or information systems across other warehouses.\\nIn contrast, if assets (inventory or warehouses in the previous examples) are less specific and can be used across multiple firms,  .\\nTable 15-1 Growth in Surplus by Third Party as a Function of Scale, Uncertainty, and Specificity Specificity of Assets Involved in Function  Low  High  Firm scale Demand uncertainty for firm  Low High Low High  High growth in surplus Low growth in surplus Low to medium growth in surplus High growth in surplus  Low to medium growth in surplus No growth in surplus unless cost of capital is lower for third party Low growth in surplus Low to medium growth in surplus  a third party can increase the surplus by aggregating uncertainty across multiple customers or improving economies of scale.\\nOne instance wherein a firm may outsource to a third party even when none of the mentioned factors suggests outsourcing is shortage of capital or a third party with a much lower cost of capital.\\nIn either of these scenarios, the third party can grow the surplus by bringing lower cost capital to the supply chain.\\nThis discussion on how and when a third party can increase the supply chain surplus is summarized in Table 15-1.\\nKey Point A firm gains the most by outsourcing to a third party if its needs are small, highly uncertain, and shared by other firms sourcing from the same third party.\\nRisks of Using a Third Party Firms must evaluate the following risks when they move any function to a third party: 1.\\nThe process is broken.\\nThe biggest problems arise when a firm outsources supply chain functions simply because it has lost control of the process.\\nKeep in mind that introducing a third party into a broken supply chain process only makes it worse and harder to control.\\nThe first step should be to get the process under control, then do a cost-benefit analysis, and only then decide on outsourcing.\\nUnderestimation of the cost of coordination.\\nA common mistake when outsourcing is to underestimate the effort required to coordinate activities across multiple entities performing supply chain tasks.\\nThis is especially true if a firm plans to outsource specific supply chain functions to different third parties.\\nOutsourcing functions to many third parties is feasible (and can be very effective) if the firm views being a coordinator as one of its core strengths.\\nA good example of a strong coordinator is Cisco.\\nHowever, even Cisco ran into trouble in the early 2000s and was left with a lot of surplus inventory because of coordination problems.\\nAn example of when coordination caused problems was between Nike and i2 Technologies in 2000.\\nNike blamed its loss of $100 million on inventory management glitches that it attributed to the supply chain planning software from i2; i2 in turn blamed the problems on Nike\\'s execution of the software.\\nClearly, insufficient coordination between the two firms played a role in this failure.\\nReduced customer/supplier contact.\\nA firm may lose customer/supplier contact by introducing an intermediary.\\nThe loss of customer contact is particularly significant for firms that sell directly to consumers but decide to use a third party to either collect incoming orders or deliver outgoing product.\\nA good example is Boise Cascade, which outsourced all its outbound  .\\ndistribution to third parties.\\nThis led to a significant loss of customer contact.\\nBoise Cascade decided to bring outbound delivery for customers located close to its distribution centers in-house.\\nGiven the high density of customers around its distribution centers, the additional gain in surplus that a third party could provide was minimal, while the gain from improved customer contact was significant.\\nBoise Cascade did not bring distribution beyond this point in-house because the gain in surplus provided by a third party was significant.\\nLoss of internal capability and growth in third-party power.\\nA firm may choose to keep a supply chain function in-house if outsourcing will significantly increase the third party\\'s power.\\nAn example can be found in the electronics industry.\\nCompanies such as HP and Motorola have moved most of their manufacturing to contract manufacturers but are reluctant to move either procurement or design, even though contract manufacturers have developed both capabilities.\\nGiven the commonality of components, it can be argued that a contract manufacturer can achieve a higher level of aggregation in procurement as well as design assets.\\nHP and Motorola, however, are reluctant to move procurement to contract manufacturers because the potential loss in power is large, whereas the aggregation gains are small given the relatively large size of both firms.\\nKeeping part of a supply chain function in-house is also important if a complete loss of capability significantly strengthens the third party\\'s bargaining position.\\nThe in-house capability then serves as an option that can be exercised when the need arises.\\nThe option also limits how much of the supply chain surplus the third party can keep for itself.\\nLeakage of sensitive data and information.\\nUsing a third party requires a firm to share demand information and in some cases intellectual property.\\nIf the third party also serves competitors, leakage is always a danger.\\nFirms have often insisted on firewalls within the third party, but a firewall increases the specificity of assets, limiting the growth in surplus that the third party can provide.\\nWhen leakage is an issue, especially with regard to intellectual property, firms often choose to keep the function in-house.\\nIneffective contracts.\\nContracts with performance metrics that distort the third party\\'s incentives often significantly reduce any gains from outsourcing.\\nFor example, cost-plus pricing of third-party services presents incentive problems even if the third party opens its books.\\nThis form of pricing eliminates incentives for the third party to innovate further to reduce costs.\\nThe onus for improvement falls back on the firm.\\nAnother example occurs when firms require suppliers or distributors to maintain a certain number of days of inventory as part of the contract.\\nSuch a contract reduces the third party\\'s incentive to take actions that reduce inventories.\\nIn such a situation, it is better for the firm to contract on a desired service level and leave the third party more freedom with regard to the amount of inventory.\\nThe third party then has an incentive to work on reducing the inventory required to provide a given level of service.\\nLoss of supply chain visibility.\\nIntroducing third parties reduces the visibility of supply chain operations, making it harder for the firm to respond quickly to local customer and market demands.\\nThis loss of visibility can be particularly harmful for long supply chains.\\nNegative reputational impact.\\nIn many instances, actions regarding labor or the environment taken by the third party can have a significant negative impact on the reputation of the firm.\\nNike has had difficulty with several of its suppliers regarding labor practices and the environment.\\nIn 2008, Nike produced its first supply chain report on suppliers in China and reported several questionable labor practices, including underage workers, unpaid wages, and falsified documents.\\nThe reputational loss from actions by a supplier can be particularly damaging to firms like Nike with strong brands.\\nA third-party logistics (3PL) provider performs one or more of the logistics activities relating to the flow of product, information, and funds that could be performed by the firm itself.\\nTraditionally, 3PLs focused on specific functions such as transportation, warehousing, and  Table 15-2

& Global Logistics Services (Armstrong & Associates, Inc., 2001) describes some of the services offered by 3PLs, as shown in Table 15-2.\\nMost 3PLs started out by focusing on one of the functions in the supply chain.\\nFor example, UPS started out as a small-package carrier.\\nSchneider started out as a truckload carrier.\\nOver the years, however, as the basic functions have become commoditized, 3PLs have expanded their range of services.\\nSeveral customers still use 3PLs to perform a specific function.\\nFor example, Grainger handles most of the order-to-delivery cycle itself, except for outbound transportation, which is outsourced to UPS.\\nUPS clearly increases the surplus in this case given the geographic dispersion of Grainger\\'s customers and the small order sizes.\\nUPS has now expanded to include warehousing, information technology, international, and a variety of other services and aims to perform a broader range of functions for its customers.\\nThe wider range of service allowed UPS to sign a contract to manage the global supply chain for National Semiconductor Corporation.\\nUPS manages the movement of chips from National Semiconductor\\'s plants to a global distribution center and on to customers around the world.\\nSimilarly, Schneider Logistics offers a wide variety of services beyond truckload transportation.\\nFor the General Motors Spare Parts Operations (GMSPO), Schneider provides comprehensive logistics services from order placement to final payment.\\nSeveral 3PLs such as UPS and FedEx have also added minor repairs and simple assembly to the set of services they offer their clients.\\nManaging simple PC repairs at a UPS hub significantly cuts down on the supply chain effort when the product is under warranty because the product never has to travel beyond the UPS hub.\\nThe trend of outsourcing a broader range of supply chain services has been growing since the late 1990s.\\nWith the increased globalization of supply chains, customers are looking for players that can manage virtually all aspects of their supply chain.\\nThis has led to the concept of a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider.\\nA 4PL was first defined by Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) as \"an integrator that assembles the resources, capabilities and technology of its own organization and other organizations to design, build and run  .\\ncomprehensive supply chain solutions.\\n\"1 Whereas a 3PL targets a function or a set of functions, a 4PL targets management of the entire process.\\nSome have described a 4PL as a general contractor who manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders, custom brokers, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a complete process for the customer.\\nWhen the idea was first formulated, Andersen conceived a neutral 4PL that did not own any logistics assets itself but only managed various logistics providers.\\nThe reality has been somewhat different.\\nHardly any neutral 4PLs have managed to establish themselves.\\nMany 3PLs, however, have started providing integrated services by which they serve as a 4PL and a lead logistics provider, covering some of the functions themselves.\\nOne example of a lead logistics provider is Kuehne & Nagel AG, a Swiss freight forwarder.\\nIt has formed Kuehne & Nagel Lead Logistics (K&N), which is positioned as a 4PL.\\nIn 2002, Nortel Networks hired K&N to handle all its outbound logistics from factories to customers.\\nK&N now manages 35 to 40 forwarders, warehouse managers, truckers, and other logistics providers worldwide for Nortel.\\nK&N itself provides some of these services to Nortel.\\nA fundamental question is how a 4PL adds value relative to a firm managing its own logistics providers.\\nAnother related question is the extent of resources that the 4PL is dedicating to a particular firm (asset specificity) and if these resources can be used elsewhere.\\nThis is particularly relevant in the case of K&N and Nortel because K&N took on nearly 100 Nortel employees who were managing the supply chain earlier.\\nOne answer often put forth is that outsourcing to K&N allows Nortel to apply its limited capital toward its core business.\\nKeep in mind, however, that outsourcing a noncore activity such as logistics does not guarantee any growth in the supply chain surplus.\\nThe K&N and Nortel relationship can survive in the long term only if K&N can increase the surplus in a way that Nortel cannot and K&N does not have significant resources dedicated solely to Nortel.\\nIn fact, in 2010, K&N had to lay off 115 employees at its warehouse in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, because of the downsizing of Nortel in that area.\\nIn this instance, K&N could not repurpose resources that were earlier dedicated to Nortel.\\nThe fundamental advantage that a 4PL may provide comes from greater visibility and coordination over a firm\\'s supply chain and improved handoffs between logistics providers.\\nGreater visibility and coordination require the use of sophisticated information technology.\\nGiven the high cost of development or purchase of this technology and the expertise required for implementation, a 4PL can increase the surplus by spreading this cost across multiple customers.\\nMany 4PLs have developed their own suite of IT applications, whereas others integrate across IT applications from multiple providers.\\nFor example, Schneider Logistics has a suite called SUMIT, whereas Exel plc Americas uses applications from a variety of providers such as i2 Technologies and CAPS.\\nA 4PL can also increase the supply chain surplus by effectively aggregating demands from customers and capacity of logistics providers.\\nAn excellent example of a firm that does both is Li & Fung, which has built a multi-billiondollar business helping global companies such as Reebok manage sourcing and production across many locations in the developing world.\\nThe company has been an intermediary between suppliers in the developing world and global buyers since it was founded in 1906.\\nLi & Fung originally exported jade, porcelain, and silk from China to the United States.\\nIn the 1970s, the firm expanded its network of suppliers and is now able to get around regional trade umbrellas such as the European Union and NAFTA by sourcing appropriately.\\nLi & Fung is an information hub that is able to link thousands of factories in 32 countries to almost a thousand customers in an optimal manner.\\nLi & Fung reserves 30 to 70 percent of a supplier\\'s capacity.\\nThese factories are accustomed to reliable repeat business from Li & Fung and are thus willing to commit this capacity.\\nLi & Fung maintains detailed capability information for each factory that is used to match it to appropriate customer orders as they arrive.\\nFor its customers, Li & Fung facilitates short lead time production.\\nThis allows customers to observe sales trends before committing to 1 Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4PL on January 29, 2006.  .\\nWhen an order arrives, Li & Fung procures yarn from one supplier, gets on the production schedule of a weaving mill, and finally farms out production of the garment to ensure that the delivery schedule is met.\\nAll of this is done to minimize production cost while meeting delivery schedules.\\nClearly, Li & Fung is an integrator that adds to the supply chain surplus in ways that no individual customer or supplier could.\\nThe firm aggregates demand across hundreds of customers and capacity across thousands of suppliers and uses detailed information on both to match supply and demand in the most cost-effective manner.\\nAs supply chains become more global, 3PLs with a broad range of services are enjoying an advantage in the marketplace.\\nThis has led to a series of mergers, with large 3PLs getting even larger.\\nWith the increasing use of postponement, especially in the electronics industry, intermediaries are being asked to take on partial manufacturing responsibilities.\\nThis has led to a blurring of the distinction between 3PLs and contract manufacturers.\\nThe larger 3PLs are increasingly trying to offer some form of final assembly as part of their service.\\nFor example, UPS has offered a variety of assembly and basic repair services to its clients.\\nContract manufacturers in turn are expanding their logistics capabilities by either buying or partnering with logistics providers.\\nCelestica, a contract manufacturer, has partnered with Exel Logistics, FedEx, Kuehne & Nagel, and Panalpina as its logistics providers.\\nAnother contract manufacturer, Flextronics, bought a few logistics providers in the early 2000s.\\nIn each case, the goal was to provide a complete production and distribution service to the customer.\\nWhen making the outsourcing decision or comparing suppliers, many firms make the fundamental mistake of focusing only on the quoted price, ignoring the fact that many factors affect the total cost of using a supplier.\\nFor instance, suppliers have different replenishment lead times.\\nDoes it pay to select a more expensive supplier with a shorter lead time?\\nOr consider suppliers that have different on-time performance.\\nIs the more reliable supplier worth the few extra pennies it charges per piece?\\nIn each of these instances, the price charged by the supplier is only one of many factors that affect the supply chain surplus.\\nWhen scoring and assessing suppliers, one can organize the factors influencing total cost as shown in Table 15-3.\\nThe performance of each potential source (including in-house production) must be rated on each of these factors because all affect the total supply chain cost.\\nIt is important to consider  Table 15-3 Factors Influencing Total Cost and Supplier Performance  Performance Category  Category Components  Supplier price Supplier terms Delivery costs Inventory costs Warehousing cost Quality

Quantifiable?\\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Difficult To some extent  .\\ntrends that may exist especially if some of the sources are located overseas.\\nTrends include exchange rates, local inflation in material and labor cost, transportation costs, and tariffs.\\nThis is especially true today given that rapid change in these factors.\\nGoel, Moussavi, and Srivatsan (2008) point out that producing a mid-range server in Asia in 2003 would have produced significant savings in 2003 relative to producing it in the United States.\\nBetween 2005 and 2008, ocean freight costs increased by 135 percent, the Chinese yuan appreciated by 18 percent, and Chinese manufacturing wages went up by 44 percent.\\nBy 2008, freight and labor costs had increased enough to make production in the United States cheaper than production in Asia.\\nUntil 2008, many manufacturers viewed offshoring as a necessity, given that the offshore prices were 25 to 40 percent lower than those of local suppliers.\\nBy 2008, however, many executives realized that longer supply chains, lack of visibility, quality problems, growing transportation costs, and rising wages in developing countries made sourcing from local suppliers much more attractive.\\nThe lower transportation distance further increases the attractiveness of local suppliers from an environmental perspective.\\nGiven that a sourcing decision is unlikely to be changed quickly, it is important to include trends and scenarios (see Chapter 6) in the total cost analysis.\\nKey Point Supplier performance should be compared based on the impact on total cost.\\nIn addition to purchase price, the total cost is influenced by supplier terms, delivery costs, inventory costs, warehousing costs, quality costs, reputational impact, support costs, other costs such as exchange rates, taxes, and supplier capabilities.\\nIn Example 15-1, we illustrate a simple comparison of two suppliers with different prices and other performance characteristics.\\nThis example considers only some of the quantifiable factors.\\nEXAMPLE 15-1 Comparing Suppliers Based on Total Cost Green Thumb, a manufacturer of lawn mowers and snowblowers has historically purchased a thousand bearings per week from a local supplier who charges $1.00 per bearing.\\nThe purchasing manager has identified another potential source willing to supply the bearings at $0.97 per bearing.\\nBefore making his decision, the purchasing manager evaluates the performance of the two suppliers.\\nThe local supplier has an average lead time of two weeks and has agreed to deliver the bearings in batches of 2,000.\\nBased on past on-time performance, the purchasing manager estimates that the lead time has a standard deviation of one week.\\nThe new source has an average lead time of six weeks with a standard deviation of four weeks.\\nThe new source requires a minimum batch size of 8,000 bearings.\\nWhich supplier should the purchasing manager go with (ignore ordering cost and focus on material cost and holding cost when making your decision)?\\nGreen Thumb has a holding cost of 25 percent.\\nIt currently uses a continuous review policy for managing inventory and aims for a cycle service level of 95 percent.\\nWeekly demand has a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\\nAnalysis: The suppliers\\' performance along lead time and lead time variability affects the safety inventory that Green Thumb must hold, and the minimum batch-size requirement affects the cycle inventory held.\\nThus, the purchasing manager should evaluate the total cost of using each supplier.\\nFirst consider the cost of using the current local supplier: Annual material cost = 1,000 * 52 * 1 = $52,000 Average cycle inventory 1using Equation 11.12 = 2,000/2 = 1,000 Annual cost of holding cycle inventory = 1,000 * 1 * 0.25 = $250  .\\nStandard deviation of demand during lead time 1using Equation 12.112 = 22 * 3002 + 1,0002 * 12 = 1,086.28 Safety inventory required with current supplier 1using Equation 12.92 = NORMSINV10.952 * 1,086.28 = 1,787 Annual cost of holding safety inventory = 1,787 * 1 * 0.25 = $447 Annual cost of using current supplier = 52,000 + 250 + 447 = $52,697 Next consider the cost of using the new supplier: Annual material cost = 1,000 * 52 * 0.97 = $50,440 Average cycle inventory 1using Equation 11.12 = 8,000/2 = 4,000 Annual cost of holding cycle inventory = 4,000 * 0.97 * 0.25 = $970 Standard deviation of demand during lead time1using Equation 12.112 = 26 * 3002 + 1,0002 * 42 = 4,066.94 Safety inventory required with current supplier 1using Equation 12.92 = NORMSINV10.952 * 4,066.94 = 6,690 Annual cost of holding safety inventory = 6,690 * 0.97 * 0.25 = $1,622 Annual cost of using new supplier = 50,440 + 970 + 1,622 = $53,032 Observe that the new supplier has a lower annual material cost but a higher annual total cost.\\nTaking all performance characteristics into account, the purchasing manager should continue to use the current supplier.\\nBefore selecting suppliers, a firm must decide whether to use single sourcing or multiple suppliers.\\nSingle sourcing guarantees the supplier sufficient business when the supplier has to make a significant buyer-specific investment.\\nThe buyer-specific investment may take the form of plant and equipment designed to produce a part that is specific to the buyer or may take the form of expertise that needs to be developed.\\nSingle sourcing is also used in the automotive industry for parts such as seats that must arrive in the sequence of production.\\nCoordinating such sequencing is impossible with multiple sources.\\nAs a result, auto companies have a single seat source for each plant but multiple seat sources across their manufacturing network.\\nHaving multiple sources ensures a degree of competition and also lowers risk by providing a backup should a source fail to deliver.\\nA good test of whether a firm has the right number of suppliers is to analyze what impact deleting or adding a supplier will have.\\nUnless each supplier has a somewhat different role, it is likely that the supply base is too large.\\nIn contrast, unless adding a supplier with a unique and valuable capability clearly adds to total cost, the supply base may be too small.\\nThe selection of suppliers is done using a variety of mechanisms, including offline competitive bids, reverse auctions, or direct negotiations.\\nNo matter what mechanism is used, supplier selection should be based on the total cost of using a supplier and not just the purchase price.\\nNext, we discuss some auction mechanisms that are often used in practice and highlight some of their properties.\\nAuctions in the Supply Chain When outsourcing to a third party, firms have historically obtained competitive bids and in recent years have used reverse auctions on the Internet.\\nCompetitive bids are a form of auction in which the bids are not revealed to the other bidders.\\nIn the following discussion, we treat them as  .\\nAn excellent discussion on auctions can be found in Krishna (2002) and Milgrom (2004).\\nMuch of the following discussion is a summary of their ideas.\\nIn many supply chain settings, a buyer looks to outsource a supply chain function such as production or transportation.\\nPotential suppliers are first qualified and then allowed to bid on how much they would charge to perform the function.\\nThe qualification process is important because there are multiple attributes of performance (as outlined in Table 15-3) that the buyer cares about.\\nWhen conducting an auction based primarily on unit price, it is thus important for the buyer to specify performance expectations along all dimensions other than price.\\nIn reality, a buyer may be better off with a multi-attribute auction, but in most cases buyers end up with specifications on various attributes and a price-only auction.\\nThe qualification process is used to identify suppliers that meet performance expectations along the non-price attributes.\\nFrom the buyer\\'s perspective, the purpose of the auction is to get bidders to reveal their underlying cost structure so that the buyer can select the supplier with the lowest costs.\\nCommonly used mechanisms for these auctions are as follows: ?Sealed-bid first-price auctions require each potential supplier to submit a sealed bid for the contract by a specified time.\\nThese bids are then opened and the contract is assigned to the lowest bidder.\\n?In English auctions, the auctioneer starts with a price and suppliers can make bids as long as each successive bid is lower than the previous bid.\\nThe supplier with the last (lowest) bid receives the contract.\\nThe difference in this case is that all suppliers get to see the current lowest bid as the auction unfolds.\\n?In Dutch auctions, the auctioneer starts with a low price and then raises it slowly until one of the suppliers agrees to the contract at that price.\\n?In second-price (Vickrey) auctions, each potential supplier submits a bid.\\nThe contract is assigned to the lowest bidder but at the price quoted by the second-lowest bidder.\\nWhen identifying the auction to use, the firm wants to minimize the price it pays.\\nIt may also care about ending up with the supplier with the lowest underlying costs because it makes it more likely that the supplier will actually be able to supply at the price it has committed to.\\nA related issue is whether suppliers have any incentive to make false bids that are not consistent with their cost structure.\\nSuch bids may increase what the firm pays and also lead to the contract being given to a firm that does not have the lowest costs.\\nAn important issue with the sealed-bid first-price auction is what is known as the \"winner\\'s curse.\"\\nOnce selected based on sealed bids, the winner quickly realizes that it could have raised its bid slightly and still won, because other suppliers bid at a higher level.\\nIn this sense, winning the bid leads the winner to realize that it left money on the table.\\nThus, bidders adjust their initial sealed bids upward, taking this phenomenon into account.\\nThis issue does not arise in any open auction, where bidders see the current best bid when planning their next bid.\\nThis issue also does not arise in the second-price auction because the winner gets the price quoted by the secondlowest bidder and thus has no incentive to hide its true cost.\\nThe following factors influence the performance of an auction: ?Is the supplier\\'s cost structure private (not affected by factors that are common to other bidders)?\\n?Are suppliers symmetric or asymmetric; that is, ex ante, are they expected to have similar cost structures?\\n?Do suppliers have all the information they need to estimate their cost structure?\\n?Does the buyer specify a maximum price it is willing to pay?\\nLet us start with the cost structures for suppliers.\\nIn most instances, it is reasonable to assume that part of the supplier\\'s cost arises from how it has structured its processes and part of its cost arises from market factors such as raw material and labor costs that are common across suppliers.\\nIn other words, the suppliers\\' cost structure is likely to be interdependent and correlated to some extent.\\nThis interdependence and correlation are likely to be higher for suppliers with  .\\nsimilar processes located in similar markets.\\nIf suppliers are symmetric with costs that are interdependent and correlated, the expected price that a firm has to pay using an English auction is no more than that in a second-price auction, which is no more than in a sealed-bid first-price auction.\\nIn other words, under these conditions the English auction is likely to fetch the lowest price for the firm.\\nIf suppliers are asymmetric, however, it is possible that a second-price auction may do better than an English auction.\\nIf the buyer firm has some information that has a direct bearing on suppliers\\' costs, and the suppliers are aware that the firm has this information but do not know the information themselves, it is in the best interest of the firm to reveal this information.\\nUnder all auction mechanisms (with symmetric bidders), the buyer pays less with all information revealed than with less information revealed.\\nThus, it is in the best interest of the buyer to specify its needs clearly and reveal all information related to the supply chain task of which it is aware.\\nNot revealing this information leads the bidders to shade their bids to guard against the winner\\'s curse, resulting in an increase in the price paid by the buyer.\\nThus, it is in the buyer\\'s interest not only to reveal all public information before bidding but also to convince potential suppliers that all information has been revealed.\\nA significant factor that must be accounted for when designing an auction is the possibility of collusion among bidders.\\nSecond-price auctions are particularly vulnerable to collusion among bidders.\\nConsider an agreement among bidders under which the bidder with the lowest cost agrees to bid its true cost, with all other bidders bidding a high number (say, the cost of the most expensive bidder or the reserve price of the buyer).\\nIn a second-price auction, the lowest-cost bidder gets to perform the supply chain function but the buyer has to a pay a higher price than the cost of the second-lowest-cost supplier.\\nThis collusion strategy results in an equilibrium because none of the other bidders has anything to gain by deviating from the collusion agreement.\\nObserve that this collusion strategy can be avoided with any first-price auction, either sealed bid or English.\\nIn either case, a collusion agreement with a high price will not hold, because many bidders will have the temptation to join the bidding if they have a lower cost.\\nUltimately, any first-price auction will bring more than the lowest-cost bidder into the auction.\\nCollusion results in suppliers suppressing their desire to provide the supply chain function and raising their bids from what would be appropriate given their cost.\\nThis is often the case in multiunit auctions, in which the buyer wants suppliers to bid on a certain quantity of the supply chain function.\\nIn multiunit Dutch auctions, the buyer starts by announcing a low price and then raises it slowly until a supplier is willing to provide one unit of the goods or services.\\nThe price is raised slowly until suppliers have committed to all units of goods or services desired by the buyer.\\nIn this auction, each unit is supplied at a different price.\\nIn a multiunit English auction, the buyer starts at a high price and bidders announce the quantity they are willing to supply.\\nIf the total quantity that suppliers are willing to supply exceeds the desired quantity, the buyer lowers the price until the quantity for which suppliers bid equals the desired quantity.\\nAll suppliers then get to supply at this price.\\nThis auction is also referred to as the uniform-price auction.\\nSuppliers in either auction can raise the final price by colluding and forming a bidding ring that assigns only one bidder to enter the auction process for the entire ring.\\nAfter the initial auction, the ring then has a separate auction to divide up the quantity it has been assigned among its members.\\nAn excellent discussion on collusion can be found in Porter (2004).\\nKey Point Buyers should structure auctions to minimize their cost and have the lowest-cost supplier(s) win with their bid.\\nOpen auctions such as the English auction are likely to achieve this outcome.\\nSealed first-price auctions are subject to the winner\\'s curse because the winner knows ex post that it could have lowered its bid and still won.\\nThis causes it to adjust its initial bid higher.\\nAuctioneers must take care to avoid collusion among bidders and make an effort to detect collusion if it has occurred.\\nBasic Principles of Negotiation In some instances, the third party that will perform a given supply chain function has been identified, and the firm enters into a negotiation to set the terms of the contract.\\nNegotiation is likely to result in a positive outcome only if the value the buyer places on outsourcing the supply chain function to this supplier is at least as large as the value the supplier places on performing the function for the buyer.\\nThe value that a supplier places on performing a function is influenced by its cost as well as other alternatives that are available for its existing capacity.\\nSimilarly, the value that the buyer places is influenced by the cost of performing the function in-house and the price available from alternative suppliers.\\nThe difference between the values of the buyer and seller is referred to as the bargaining surplus.\\nThe goal of each negotiating party is to capture as much of the bargaining surplus as possible.\\nAn excellent discussion on negotiations is available in Thompson (2005).\\nWe mention some of the highlights from her discussion.\\nThe first recommendation is to have a clear idea of your own value and as good an estimate of the third party\\'s value as possible.\\nA good estimate of the bargaining surplus improves the chance of a successful outcome.\\nSuppliers of Toyota have often mentioned that \"Toyota knows our costs better than we do,\" which leads to better negotiations.\\nThe second recommendation is to look for a fair outcome based on equally or equitably dividing the bargaining surplus or dividing it based on needs.\\nEquity here refers to a division of the surplus in proportion to the contribution by each party.\\nThe key to a successful negotiation, however, is to make it a win-win outcome.\\nIt is impossible to obtain a win-win outcome if the two parties are negotiating on a single dimension such as price.\\nIn this setting, one party can only \"win\" at the expense of the other.\\nTo create a win-win negotiation, the two parties have to identify more than one issue to negotiate.\\nIdentifying multiple issues allows the opportunity to expand the pie if the two parties have different preferences.\\nThis is often easier than it seems in a supply chain setting.\\nA buyer typically cares not just about the price of performing the supply chain function but also about the responsiveness and quality (two of the dimensions identified in Table 15-3).\\nIf the supplier finds it harder to lower the price but easier to reduce the response time, there is an opportunity for a win-win resolution in which the supplier offers better responsiveness without changing the price.\\nThompson discusses many hurdles in the negotiation process and also suggests effective strategies.\\nA supply contract specifies parameters governing the buyer-supplier relationship.\\nIn addition to making the terms of the buyer-supplier relationship explicit, contracts have significant impact on the behavior and performance of all stages in a supply chain.\\nContracts should be designed to facilitate desirable supply chain outcomes by growing the supply chain surplus and minimizing actions that hurt performance.\\nA manager should ask the following three questions when designing a supply chain contract: 1.\\nHow will the contract affect the firm\\'s profits and total supply chain profits?\\nWill the incentives in the contract introduce any information distortion?\\nHow will the contract influence supplier performance along key performance measures?\\nIdeally, a contract should be structured to increase the firm\\'s profits and supply chain profits, discourage information distortion, and offer incentives to the supplier to improve performance along key dimensions.\\nMany shortcomings in supply chain performance occur because the buyer and supplier are different entities, each trying to optimize its own profits.\\nContracts for Product Availability and Supply Chain Profits Independent actions taken by two parties in a supply chain often result in profits that are lower than those that could be achieved if the supply chain were to coordinate its actions with a  .\\ncommon objective of maximizing supply chain profits.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 11, double marginalization reduces supply chain profits because the supply chain margin is divided between the two parties, and each stage makes its decisions considering only its own margin.\\nWe now discuss several other instances in which double marginalization leads to a loss in supply chain performance in the presence of demand uncertainty.\\nGiven demand uncertainty, a manufacturer wants the retailer to carry a large inventory of its product to ensure that any surge in demand can be satisfied.\\nThe retailer, on the other hand, loses money on any unsold inventory.\\nAs a result, the retailer prefers to carry a lower level of inventory.\\nThis tension leads to a supply chain outcome that is suboptimal.\\nIn a contract in which the supplier specifies a fixed price and the buyer decides on the quantity to be purchased, the most common cause for suboptimal supply chain performance is double marginalization.\\nThe retailer makes its buying decision before demand is realized and thus bears all the demand uncertainty.\\nIf demand is less than the retailer\\'s inventory, the retailer has to liquidate unsold product at a discount.\\nGiven uncertain demand, the retailer decides on the purchase quantity based on its margin and the cost of overstocking as discussed in Chapter 13.\\nThe retailer\\'s margin, however, is lower than the contribution margin for the entire supply chain, whereas its cost of overstocking is higher than that for the entire supply chain.\\nAs a result, the retailer is conservative and aims for a lower level of product availability than is optimal for the supply chain leading to a loss of supply chain surplus.\\nConsider a music store that sells compact discs.\\nThe supplier buys (or manufactures) compact discs at $1 per unit and sells them to the music store at $5 per unit.\\nThe retailer sells each disc to the end consumer at $10.\\nAt this retail price, market demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\\nThe retailer has a margin of $5 per disc and can potentially lose $5 for each unsold disc.\\nUsing Equation 13.1, it is optimal for the retailer to aim for a service level of 0.5 and order 1,000 discs.\\nFrom Equation 13.3, the retailer\\'s expected profits are $3,803, and the manufacturer makes $4,000 from selling 1,000 discs.\\nFor the supply chain, however, the supplier and the retailer together have a margin of $9 and can lose a maximum of only $1 per unsold disc.\\nFor the entire supply chain, it is thus optimal to aim for a service level of 0.9 and stock 1,384 discs.\\nThe expected supply chain profit in this case is $8,474.\\nThe music store is thus conservative and carries fewer discs than are optimal for the supply chain.\\nAs a result, the supply chain makes $670 less than it would expect to if the retailer and the supplier worked together.\\nTo improve overall profits, the supplier must design a contract that encourages the buyer to purchase more and increase the level of product availability.\\nThis requires the supplier to share in some of the buyer\\'s demand uncertainty.\\nThree contracts that increase overall profits by making the supplier share some of the buyer\\'s demand uncertainty are as follows: 1.\\nBuyback or returns contracts 2.\\nRevenue-sharing contracts 3.\\nQuantity flexibility contracts We illustrate each of the three contracts using the example of the music store and discuss their performance in terms of the three questions raised earlier.\\nBUYBACK CONTRACTS A buyback or returns clause in a contract allows a retailer to return unsold inventory up to a specified amount, at an agreed-upon price.\\nIn a buyback contract, the manufacturer specifies a wholesale price c along with a buyback price b at which the retailer can return any unsold units at the end of the season.\\nWe assume that the manufacturer can salvage $sM for any units that the retailer returns.\\nThe manufacturer has a cost of v per unit produced.\\nThe retail price is p. The optimal order quantity O* for a retailer in response to a buyback contract is evaluated using Equations 13.1 and 13.2, where the salvage value for the retailer is s = b.\\nThe cost of overstocking for the retailer is given by Co  c  b, and the cost of understocking for the retailer is given by Cu  p  c. Using Equation 13.1, the optimal service level that the retailer  .\\ntargets is thus given by CSL* = (p-c)  (p-b).\\nUsing Equation 13.2, the optimal order size by the retailer is given by O*  NORMINV(CSL*, , ).\\nThe expected retailer profit is evaluated using Equation 13.3 with the salvage value s equal to the buyback price b.\\nThe expected profit at the manufacturer depends on the overstock at the retailer (evaluated using Equation 13.4) that is returned.\\nWe obtain Expected manufacturer profit = O*1c - v2 - 1b - sM2 * expected overstock at retailer Continuing with the example of the music store, we have production cost v  $1, wholesale price c  $5, retail price p  $10, and the manufacturer\\'s salvage value of unsold items sM 0.\\nRetail demand at a retail price of $10 is assumed to be normally distributed, with a mean of m = 1,000 and a standard deviation of s = 300.\\nRecall that without a buyback clause, that is b  0, the retailer finds it optimal to target a service level of CSL* = 0.5 and order O*  1,000 units because the cost of overstocking is Co  c ?b  5 ?0  $5, and the cost of understocking is Cu  p ?c  10 ?5  $5.\\nIf the supplier to the music store agrees to buy back discs that have not sold at b  $3 per disc, the cost of overstocking for the retailer for each unsold disc decreases from $5 to $2 (5 ?3) while the cost of understocking stays at $5.\\nThe presence of the buyback clause makes it optimal for the retailer to increase the service level from 0.5 to 5  (52)  0.71 and the order size from 1,000 to 1,170.\\nThis change results in higher product availability and higher profits for both the retailer ($4,286 instead of $3,803) and the supplier ($4,009 instead of $4,000) as shown in Table 15-4 (constructed using worksheet Table15-4 in spreadsheet Ch15Contracts).\\nIt is clear that the retailer\\'s profits increase because his cost of overstocking has decreased.\\nDespite buying back unsold inventory at $3, the supplier\\'s profits increase because the retailer, on average, sells more product (on which the supplier makes $4 per unit) as shown in Table 15-4.\\nBuyback contracts are most effective for products with a low variable cost.\\nExamples include music, software, books, magazines, and newspapers.\\nFrom Table 15-4, observe that the use of buyback contracts increases total supply chain profits by about 20 percent when the wholesale price is $7 per disc.\\nFor a fixed wholesale price, increasing the buyback price always increases retailer profits.\\nIn general, there exists a positive buyback price that is a fraction of the wholesale price, at which the manufacturer makes a higher profit compared to offering no buyback.\\nAlso observe that buybacks increase profits for the manufacturer more as the manufacturer\\'s margin increases.\\nIn Table 15-4, buybacks are found to be more helpful to the manufacturer when the wholesale price is $7 relative to when the wholesale price is $5.\\nThus, the greater the manufacturer\\'s margin, the more she stands to benefit through the use of some mechanism such as buybacks.\\nTable 15-4 Order Sizes and Profits in Music Supply Chain Under Different Buyback Contracts  Wholesale Buyback Optimal Order Size Expected Profit Expected Returns Expected Profit Expected Supply  Price c Price b for Music Store for Music Store to Supplier  for

$8,351  .\\nFor a fixed wholesale price, as the buyback price increases, the retailer orders more and also returns more.\\nIn our analysis in Table 15-4, we have not considered the cost associated with a return.\\nAs the cost associated with a return increases, buyback contracts become less attractive because the cost of returns reduces supply chain profits.\\nIf return costs are high, buyback contracts can reduce the total profits of the supply chain far more than is the case without any buyback.\\nIn 1932, Viking Press was the first book publisher to accept returns.\\nToday, buyback contracts are common in the book industry, and publishers accept unsold books from retailers.\\nTo minimize the cost associated with a return, retailers do not have to return the book, only the cover.\\nWhen publishers can verify retailer sales electronically, nothing has to be returned.\\nThe goal in either case is for the publisher to get proof that the book did not sell while reducing the cost of the return.\\nOver the years, considerable debate has taken place about the impact of publishers\\' returns policy on profits in the industry.\\nOur discussion provides some justification for the approach taken by the publishers.\\nKey Point Manufacturers can use buyback contracts to increase their own profits as well as total supply chain profits.\\nBuybacks encourage retailers to increase the level of product availability.\\nIn some instances, manufacturers use holding-cost subsidies or price protection to encourage retailers to order more.\\nWith holding-cost subsidies, manufacturers pay retailers a certain amount for every unit held in inventory over a given period.\\nHolding-cost subsidies are prevalent in automotive supply chains.\\nIn the high-tech industry, in which products lose value rapidly, manufacturers share the risk of product becoming obsolete by providing price support to retailers.\\nMany manufacturers guarantee that in the event they drop prices, they will also lower prices for all inventories that the retailer is currently carrying and compensate the retailer accordingly.\\nAs a result, the cost of overstocking at the retailer is limited to the cost of capital and physical storage and does not include obsolescence, which can be more than 100 percent a year for high-tech products.\\nThe retailer thus increases the level of product availability in the presence of price support.\\nBoth holding-cost subsidies and price support are forms of buyback.\\nA downside to the buyback clause (or any equivalent practice such as holding-cost subsidy or price support) is that it leads to surplus inventory that must be salvaged or disposed.\\nThe task of returning unsold product increases supply chain costs.\\nThe cost of returns can be eliminated if the manufacturer gives the retailer a markdown allowance and allows it to sell the product at a significant discount.\\nPublishers today generally do not ask retailers to return unsold books.\\nInstead, they give a markdown allowance for them.\\nRetailers mark them down and sell them for a considerable discount.\\nFor a given level of product availability at the retailer, the presence of a buyback clause can also hurt sales because it leads the retailer to exert less effort to sell than it would without buybacks.\\nThe reduction in retailer effort in the presence of buyback occurs because its loss from unsold inventory is higher when there is no buyback, leading to a higher sales effort for products with no buyback.\\nThe supplier can counter the reduction in sales effort by limiting the amount of buyback permitted.\\nThe structure of a buyback clause leads to the entire supply chain reacting to the order placed by the retailer and not actual customer demand.\\nIf a supplier is selling to multiple retailers, it produces based on the orders placed by each retailer.\\nEach retailer bases its order on its cost of overstocking and understocking (see Chapter 13).\\nAfter actual sales materialize, unsold inventory is returned to the supplier separately from each retailer.\\nAs a result, the structure of the buyback clause increases information distortion when a supplier is selling to multiple retailers.\\nAt the end of the sales season, however, the supplier does obtain information on actual sales.\\nInformation distortion is driven primarily by the fact that inventory is disaggregated at the retailers.\\nis centralized at the supplier and sent out only as needed to the retailers, information distortion can be reduced.\\nWith centralized inventory, the supplier can exploit independence of demand across retailers to carry a lower level of inventory.\\nIn practice, however, most buyback contracts have decentralized inventory at retailers.\\nAs a result, there is a high level of information distortion.\\nKey Point Buyback contracts lead to a lower retailer effort in case of overstocking and increased information distortion within the supply chain.\\nBuybacks are best limited to products with small per unit production cost.\\nREVENUE-SHARING CONTRACTS In revenue-sharing contracts, the manufacturer charges the retailer a low wholesale price c, and shares a fraction f of the retailer\\'s revenue.\\nEven if no returns are allowed, the lower wholesale price decreases the cost to the retailer in case of an overstock.\\nThe retailer thus increases the level of product availability resulting in higher profits for both the manufacturer and the retailer.\\nAssume that the manufacturer has a production cost v; the retailer charges a retail price p and can salvage any leftover units for sR.\\nThe optimal order quantity O* ordered by the retailer is evaluated using Equations 13.1 and 13.2, where the cost of understocking is Cu = 11 - f2p - c and the cost of overstocking is Co = c - sR. We thus obtain  CSL* = probability1demand ... O*2 =  Cu Cu + Co  =  11 - f2p - c 11 - f2p - sR  The manufacturer obtains the wholesale price c for each unit purchased by the retailer and a share of the revenue for each unit sold by the retailer.\\nThe expected overstock at the retailer is obtained using Equation 13.4.\\nThe manufacturer\\'s profits are thus evaluated as  Expected manufacturers profits = 1c - v2 O* + fp1O* - expected overstock at retailer2  The retailer pays a wholesale price c for each unit purchased and obtains a revenue of 11 - f2p for each unit sold and a revenue of sR for each unit overstocked.\\nThe retailer\\'s expected profit is thus evaluated as  Expected retailer profit = 11 - f2p1O* - expected overstock at retailer2 + sR * expected overstock at retailer - cO* We return to the example of the music store.\\nThe supplier agrees to sell each disc to the music store at c = $1, but the music store agrees to share 45 percent of the revenue from each disc sold.\\nIf each disc is priced at $10, the supplier gets $4.5 for each disc sold and the music store keeps $5.5.\\nRecall that at a retail price of $10, demand for discs is normally distributed, with a mean of m = 1,000 and a standard deviation of s = 300.\\nThe music store has a cost of overstocking of Co = c - sR = 1 - 0 = $1 and a cost of understocking of Cu = 11 - f2p - c = (1 - 0.45) * 10 - 1 = $4.5.\\nThe music store targets a service level of CSL*  4.5  (4.5  1)  0.818 or 81.8 percent (see Equation 13.1) and orders 1,273 discs.\\nObserve that this is much larger than when the wholesale price was $5 and there was no revenue sharing.\\nThe increase in order size occurs because the retailer loses only $1 per unsold disc (instead of $5 per disc without revenue sharing), while making a margin of $4.5 for each disc that sells.\\nTable 15-5 (constructed using worksheet Table15-5 in spreadsheet Ch15Contracts) provides the outcome in terms of order sizes and profits for different wholesale prices and  .\\nTable 15-5 Order Sizes and Profits in Music Supply Chain Under Different Revenue-Sharing Contracts  Wholesale Price c  Revenue-Sharing Fraction f  Optimal Order Size for Music Store  Expected Overstock at Music Store  Expected Profit for Music Store  $1 0.30 $1 0.45 $1 0.60 $2 0.30 $2 0.45 $2 0.60  1,320 1,273 1,202 1,170 1,105 1,000  342 $5,526 302 $4,064 247 $2,619 223 $4,286 179 $2,881 120 $1,521  Expected Profit for Supplier $2,934 $4,367 $5,732 $4,009 $5,269 $6,282  Expected Supply Chain Profit $8,460 $8,431 $8,350 $8,295 $8,150 $7,803  revenue-sharing fractions f. From Tables 15-4 and 15-5, observe that revenue sharing allows both the manufacturer and retailer to increase their profits in the absence of buybacks compared to the case in which the wholesaler sells for a fixed price of $5 without buybacks.\\nWhen charging a wholesale price of $5, the supplier makes profit of $4,000 and the music store makes a profit of $3,803 (see Table 15-4).\\nWith a revenue-sharing contract that has a wholesale price of c  $1 and the supplier shares 45 percent of the revenue (the supplier gets revenue of $4.5 for each jacket sold), however, the supplier makes a profit of $4,367 and the retailer makes a profit of $4,064.\\nRevenue-sharing contracts also result in lower retailer effort compared to when the retailer pays an up-front wholesale price and keeps the entire revenue from a sale.\\nThe drop in effort results because the retailer gets only a fraction of the revenue from each sale.\\nOne advantage of revenue-sharing contracts over buyback contracts is that no product needs to be returned, thus eliminating the cost of returns.\\nRevenue-sharing contracts are best suited for products with low variable cost and a high cost of return.\\nA good example of revenue-sharing contracts was implemented between Blockbuster video rentals and movie studios for videos.\\nA studio sold each cassette to Blockbuster at a low price and then shared in the revenue generated from each rental.\\nGiven the low price, Blockbuster purchased many copies, resulting in more rentals and higher profits for both Blockbuster and the studio.\\nThe revenue-sharing contract does require an information infrastructure that allows the supplier to monitor sales at the retailer.\\nSuch an infrastructure can be expensive to build.\\nAs a result, revenue-sharing contracts may be difficult to manage for a supplier selling to many small buyers.\\nAs in buyback contracts, revenue-sharing contracts also result in the supply chain producing to retailer orders rather than actual consumer demand.\\nThis information distortion results in excess inventory in the supply chain and a greater mismatch of supply and demand.\\nThe information distortion increases as the number of retailers to which the supplier sells grows.\\nAs with buyback contracts, information distortion from revenue-sharing contracts can be reduced if retailers reserve production capacity or inventory at the supplier rather than buying product and holding it in inventory themselves.\\nThis allows aggregation of the variability across multiple retailers, and the supplier has to hold a lower level of capacity or inventory.\\nIn practice, however, most revenuesharing contracts are implemented with the retailer buying and holding inventory.\\nKey Point Revenue-sharing contracts counter double marginalization by decreasing the cost per unit charged to the retailer, thus effectively decreasing the cost of overstocking.\\nRevenue-sharing contracts increase information distortion and lead to a lower retailer effort in case of overstocking, just as buyback contracts do.\\nQUANTITY FLEXIBILITY CONTRACTS Under quantity flexibility contracts, the manufacturer allows the retailer to change the quantity ordered (within limits) after observing demand.\\nIf a retailer orders O units, the manufacturer commits to providing up to Q = 11 + a2O units, whereas the retailer is committed to buying at least q = 11 - b2O units.\\nBoth a and b are between 0 and 1.\\nThe retailer can purchase anywhere between q and Q units, depending on the demand it observes.\\nThese contracts are similar to buyback contracts in that the manufacturer now bears some of the risk of having excess inventory.\\nBecause no returns are required, these contracts can be more effective than buyback contracts when the cost of returns is high.\\nWhen the supplier is selling to multiple retailers, these contracts are more effective than buyback contracts because they allow the supplier to aggregate uncertainties across multiple retailers and thus lower the level of excess inventory.\\nQuantity flexibility contracts increase the average amount the retailer purchases and may increase total supply chain profits when structured appropriately.\\nAssume that the manufacturer incurs a production cost of $v per unit and charges a wholesale price of $c from the retailer.\\nThe retailer in turn sells to customers for a price of $p.\\nThe retailer salvages any leftover units for sR.\\nThe manufacturer salvages any leftover units for sM.\\nIf retailer demand is normally distributed, with a mean of m and a standard deviation of s, we can evaluate the impact of a quantity flexibility contract.\\nIf the retailer orders O units, the manufacturer is committed to supplying Q units.\\nAs a result, we assume that the manufacturer produces Q units.\\nThe retailer purchases q units if demand D is less than q, D units if demand D is between q and Q, and Q units if demand D is greater than Q.\\nNote that in the following formulas, FS is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and fS is the standard normal density function discussed in Appendix 12A of Chapter 12.\\nWe thus obtain  Expected quantity purchased by retailer, QR = qF1q2 + Q[1 - F1Q2]  Q-m  q-m  + m c Fs a s b - Fs a s b d  Q-m  q-m  - s c fs a s b - fs a s b d  Expected quantity sold by retailer, DR = Q[1 - F1Q2]  Q-m  q-m  + mFs a s b - sfs a s b  Expected overstock at manufacturer = QR - DR Expected retailer profit = DR * p + 1QR - DR2sR - QR * c Expected manufacturer profit = QR * c + 1Q - QR2sM - Q * v  In our example, the music store would place an initial order for, say, 1,000 discs.\\nCloser to the release date, as the store got a better idea of actual demand, it would be allowed to modify its order to any number between (say) 950 and 1,050.\\nIn this contract, the retailer modifies its order as it gains better market intelligence over time.\\nThe supplier in turn sends only the modified order quantity.\\nThe amount ordered by the retailer is more in line with actual demand, resulting in higher profits for the supply chain.\\nFor a supplier, the quantity flexibility contract makes sense if it has flexible capacity that can be used to produce at least the uncertain part of the order after the retailer has decided on the modification.\\nA quantity flexibility contract is also effective if a supplier is selling to multiple retailers with independent demand because it allows uncertainties to be aggregated by the supplier.\\nIn Table 15-6, we show the impact of different quantity flexibility contracts on profitability for the music supply chain when demand is normally distributed, with a mean of m = 1,000 and a standard deviation of s = 300 (see worksheet Table 15-6 in spreadsheet Ch15Contracts).\\nWe assume a wholesale price of c = $5 and a retail price of p = $10.\\nAll contracts considered are such that a = b.\\nThe results in Table 15-6 are built in two steps.\\nTable 15-6 Profits at Music Supply Chain Under Different Quantity Flexibility Contracts  Expected Expected Expected Expected  Wholesale  Order  Purchase  Sale by Profits

(say     0.2).\\nThe next step is to identify the optimal order size for the retailer.\\nThis is done using Excel by selecting an order size that maximizes expected retailer profits given  and .\\nFor example, when     0.05 and c  $5, retailer profits are maximized for an order size of O  1,017.\\nFor this order size, we obtain a supplier commitment to deliver up to Q  (1  0.05)  1,017  1,067 and a retailer commitment to buy at least q  (1  0.05)  1,017  966 discs.\\nIn our analysis, we assume that the supplier produces Q  1,067 discs and sends the precise number (between 966 and 1,067) demanded by the retailer.\\nSuch a policy results in retailer profits of $4,038 and supplier profits of $4,004.\\nFrom Table 15-6, observe that quantity flexibility contracts allow both the manufacturer and the retailer to increase their profits.\\nObserve that as the manufacturer increases the wholesale price, it is optimal for it to offer greater quantity flexibility to the retailer.\\nQuantity flexibility contracts are common for components in the electronics and computer industry.\\nIn the previous discussion, we considered fairly simple quantity flexibility contracts.\\nBenetton has used sophisticated quantity flexibility contracts with its retailers successfully to increase supply chain profits.\\nWe describe such a contract in the context of colored knit garments.2 Seven months before delivery, Benetton retailers were required to place their orders.\\nConsider a retailer placing an order for 100 sweaters each in red, blue, and yellow.\\nOne to three months before delivery, retailers could alter up to 30 percent of the quantity ordered in any color and assign it to another color.\\nThe aggregate order, however, could not be adjusted at this stage.\\nPotentially, the retailer could change the order to 70 red, 70 blue, and 160 yellow sweaters.\\nAfter the start of the sales season, retailers were allowed to order up to 10 percent of their previous order in any color.\\nPotentially, the retailer could order another 30 yellow sweaters.\\nIn this quantity flexibility contract, Benetton retailers had a flexibility of up to 10 percent on the aggregate order across all colors and of about 40 percent for individual colors.\\nRetailers could increase the aggregate quantity ordered by up to 10 percent and the quantity for any individual color could be adjusted by up to 40 percent.\\nThis flexibility is consistent with the fact that aggregate forecasts are more accurate than forecasts for individual colors.\\nAs a result, retailers could better match product availability with demand.\\nThe guaranteed portion of the order was manufactured by Benetton using an inexpensive but long lead time production process.\\nThe flexible part of the order (about 35 percent) was manufactured using postponement.\\nThe result was a better matching of supply and demand at lower cost than in the absence of such a contract.\\nThe quantity flexibility contract allowed both the retailers and Benetton to increase their profits.\\n2 See Heskett and Signorelli (1984).\\nIf the supplier has flexible capacity, a quantity flexibility contract increases profits for the entire supply chain and also each party.\\nThe quantity flexibility contract requires either inventory or excess flexible capacity to be available at the supplier.\\nIf the supplier is selling to multiple retailers with independent demand, the aggregation of inventory leads to a smaller surplus inventory (see Chapter 12) with a quantity flexibility contract compared to either a buyback or revenue-sharing contract.\\nInventories can be further reduced if the supplier has excess flexible capacity.\\nQuantity flexibility contracts are thus preferred for products with high marginal cost or when surplus capacity is available.\\nTo be effective, quantity flexibility contracts require the retailer to be good at gathering market intelligence and improving its forecasts closer to the point of sale.\\nRelative to buyback and revenue-sharing contracts, quantity flexibility contracts have less information distortion.\\nConsider the case with multiple retailers.\\nWith a buyback contract, the supply chain must produce based on the retailer orders that are placed well before actual demand arises.\\nThis leads to surplus inventory being disaggregated at each retailer.\\nWith a quantity flexibility contract, retailers specify only the range within which they will purchase, well before actual demand arises.\\nIf demand at various retailers is independent, the supplier does not need to plan production to the high end of the order range for each retailer.\\nIt can aggregate uncertainty across all retailers and build a lower level of surplus inventory than would be needed if inventory were disaggregated at each retailer.\\nRetailers then order closer to the point of sale, when demand is more visible and less uncertain.\\nThe aggregation of uncertainty results in less information distortion with a quantity flexibility contract.\\nLike the other contracts discussed, quantity flexibility contracts result in lower retailer effort.\\nIn fact, any contract that gets retailers to provide a higher level of product availability by not making them fully responsible for overstocking will result in a lowering of retailer effort for a given level of inventory.\\nKey Point Quantity flexibility contracts counter double marginalization by giving the retailer the ability to modify the order based on improved forecasts closer to the point of sale.\\nThese contracts result in lower information distortion than buyback or revenue-sharing contracts when a supplier sells to multiple buyers or the supplier has excess, flexible capacity.\\nContracts to Coordinate Supply Chain Costs Differences in costs at the buyer and supplier also lead to decisions that increase total supply chain costs.\\nAn example is the replenishment lot size decision typically made by the buyer as discussed in Chapter 11.\\nThe buyer decides on its optimal lot size based on its fixed cost per lot and the cost of holding inventory.\\nThe buyer does not account for the supplier\\'s costs.\\nIf the supplier has a high fixed cost per lot, the optimal lot size for the buyer increases total cost for the supplier and the supply chain.\\nIn such a situation, the supplier can use a quantity discount contract to encourage the buyer to order in lot sizes that minimize total costs (see Chapter 11).\\nThe objective of such a contract is to encourage the retailer to buy in larger lot sizes that lower cost for the supplier and the entire supply chain.\\nA quantity discount contract decreases overall costs but leads to higher lot sizes and thus higher levels of inventory in the supply chain.\\nIt is typically justified only for commodity products for which the supplier has high fixed costs per lot.\\nIt is important to modify the terms of the contract as operational improvements are made at the supplier, resulting in lower fixed costs per batch.\\nQuantity discounts increase information distortion in the supply chain because such contracts increase order batching.\\nRetailers order less frequently, and any demand variations are exaggerated when orders are placed.\\nThe supplier receives information less frequently and all variations are increased because of this batching.\\nThis information distortion is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10.  .\\nKey Point Quantity discounts can coordinate supply chain costs if the supplier has large fixed costs per lot.\\nQuantity discounts, however, increase information distortion as a result of order batching.\\nContracts to Increase Agent Effort In many supply chains, agents act on behalf of a principal and the agents\\' efforts affect the reward for the principal.\\nAs an example, consider a car dealer (the agent) selling cars for Chrysler (the principal).\\nThe dealer also sells other brands and used cars.\\nEvery month, the dealer allocates its sales effort (advertising, promotions, etc.)\\nacross all brands it sells and the used cars.\\nEarnings for Chrysler are based on sales of its brands, which in turn are affected by the effort exerted by the dealer.\\nSales can be observed directly, whereas effort is hard to observe and measure.\\nGiven double marginalization, the dealer always exerts less effort than is optimal from the perspective of Chrysler and the supply chain.\\nThus, Chrysler must offer an incentive contract that encourages the dealer to increase effort.\\nIn theory, a two-part tariff offers the right incentives for the dealer to exert the appropriate amount of effort.\\nIn a two-part tariff, Chrysler extracts its profits up front as a franchise fee and then sells cars to the dealer at cost.\\nThe dealer\\'s margin is then the same as the supply chain margin, and the dealer exerts the right amount of effort.\\nAnother contract, observed more frequently in practice, increases the margin for the dealer as sales cross certain thresholds.\\nChrysler offered such a contract to dealers in the first quarter of 2001, which was structured roughly as follows.\\nDealers would keep the margin made from customers if sales for the month were less than 75 percent of an agreed-upon target.\\nHowever, if sales reached or exceeded 75 percent but were less than 100 percent, the dealer would get an additional $150 per car sold.\\nIf sales reached or exceeded 100 percent but were less than 110 percent, the dealer would get an additional $250 per car sold.\\nIf sales reached or exceeded 110 percent, the dealer would get an additional $500 per car sold.\\nChrysler\\'s hope was that by increasing the margin for higher thresholds, the dealer would have an incentive to increase effort on sales of Chrysler cars.\\nAlthough threshold contracts clearly encourage the dealer to try to reach higher thresholds, they can significantly increase information distortion by encouraging the agent to exacerbate demand variability.\\nThe first month after the new contract was announced, the U.S. car industry saw sales drop.\\nChrysler, however, saw sales drop by twice the industry average.\\nThere are two potential causes for this behavior.\\nFirst, under the contract, the dealer makes more money selling 900 cars one month and 1,100 the next month compared to selling a thousand cars each month.\\nThe dealer has an incentive to shift demand over time to achieve such an outcome, thus increasing information distortion and observed demand variation.\\nThe second cause is that within the first week of the month, the dealer has an idea of the threshold range it is likely to reach.\\nFor example, if the dealer believes that it can easily cross the 75 percent threshold but has little chance of crossing the 100 percent threshold, it will decrease its effort for the month and save it for later, because the marginal benefit of selling an additional car is only $150.\\nIn contrast, if demand for the month is high and the dealer believes it can easily cross the 100 percent threshold, it is likely to exert additional effort to reach the 110 percent threshold because the marginal benefit from reaching that threshold is high.\\nThus, Chrysler\\'s incentive contract increases variation in dealer effort, further exaggerating any existing demand variation.\\nInformation distortion is also observed in threshold contracts offered by companies to their sales staff.\\nUnder these contracts, staff is offered rewards for crossing sales thresholds during a specified period of time (e.g., a quarter).\\nThe problem observed is that sales effort and orders peak during the last week or two of the quarter, as salespeople try to cross the threshold.\\nObserved sales are thus highly uneven during the quarter.\\nThis information distortion arises  .\\nbecause the incentive is offered over a fixed time period, making the last week or two of each quarter a period of intense activity for all sales staff.\\nGiven the information distortion arising from threshold contracts, a key question is how a firm can decrease information distortion while maintaining the incentive for the agent to exert extra effort.\\nOne approach is to offer threshold incentives over a rolling horizon.\\nFor example, if a firm offers its sales staff weekly incentives based on sales over the past 13 weeks, each week becomes the last week of a 13-week period.\\nSales effort thus becomes more even compared to when the entire sales staff has the same last week for their bonus evaluation.\\nGiven the presence of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, implementing a rolling horizon contract is much easier today than it once was.\\nKey Point Two-part tariffs and threshold contracts can be used to counter double marginalization and increase agent effort in a supply chain.\\nThreshold contracts, however, increase information distortion and are best implemented on a rolling horizon.\\nContracts to Induce Performance Improvement In many instances, a buyer wants performance improvement from a supplier that has little incentive to do so.\\nA buyer with sufficient power in the supply chain may be able to force the supplier to comply.\\nA buyer without sufficient power requires an appropriate contract to induce the supplier to improve performance.\\nEven for a powerful buyer, however, an appropriate contract designed to encourage supplier cooperation results in a better outcome.\\nAs an example, consider a buyer that wants the supplier to improve performance by reducing lead time for a seasonal item.\\nThis is an important component of all quick response (QR) initiatives in a supply chain.\\nWith a shorter lead time, the buyer hopes to have better forecasts and be better able to match supply and demand.\\nMost of the work to reduce lead time has to be done by the supplier, whereas most of the benefit accrues to the buyer in terms of reduced inventories and overstocking.\\nIn fact, the supplier will lose sales because the buyer will now carry less safety inventory because of shorter lead times and better forecasts.\\nTo induce the supplier to reduce lead time, the buyer can use a shared-savings contract, with the supplier getting a fraction of the savings that result from reducing lead time.\\nAs long as the supplier\\'s share of the savings compensates for any effort it has to put in, its incentive will be aligned with that of the buyer, resulting in an outcome that benefits both parties.\\nA similar issue arises when a buyer wants to encourage the supplier to improve quality.\\nImproving supply quality improves the buyer\\'s costs but requires additional effort from the supplier.\\nOnce again, a shared-savings contract is a good way to align incentives between the buyer and supplier.\\nThe buyer can share savings from improved quality with the supplier.\\nThis will encourage the supplier to improve quality to a higher level than what the supplier would choose in the absence of the shared savings.\\nAnother example arises in the context of toxic chemicals that may be used by a manufacturer.\\nThe manufacturer would like to decrease the use of these toxic chemicals.\\nGenerally, the supplier is better equipped to identify ways of reducing use of these chemicals because this is its core business.\\nIt has no incentive to work with the buyer on reducing use of these chemicals because that will reduce the supplier\\'s sales.\\nA shared-savings contract can be used to align incentives between the supplier and the manufacturer.\\nIf the manufacturer shares the savings that result from a reduction in the use of toxic chemicals with the supplier, the supplier will make the effort to reduce use of the chemicals as long as its share of the savings compensates for the loss in margin from reduced sales.\\nIn general, shared-savings contracts are effective in aligning supplier and buyer incentives when the supplier is required to improve performance along a particular dimension and most of the benefits of improvement accrue to the buyer.\\nA powerful buyer may couple shared savings with penalties for a lack of improvement to further encourage the supplier to improve performance.\\nSuch contracts will increase profits for both the buyer and the supplier while achieving outcomes that are beneficial to the supply chain.\\nKey Point Shared-savings contracts can be used to induce performance improvement from a supplier along dimensions, such as lead time, where the benefit of improvement accrues primarily to the buyer but the effort for improvement comes primarily from the supplier.\\nTwo statistics highlight the importance of design collaboration between a manufacturer and suppliers.\\nToday, typically between 50 and 70 percent of the spending at a manufacturer comes from procurement, compared to only about 20 percent several decades ago.\\nSecond, it is generally accepted that about 80 percent of the cost of a purchased part is fixed during the design stage.\\nThus, it is crucial for a manufacturer to collaborate with suppliers during the design stage if product costs are to be kept low.\\nDesign collaboration can lower the cost of purchased material and also lower logistics and manufacturing costs.\\nDesign collaboration is also important for a company trying to provide variety and customization, because failure to do so can significantly raise the cost of variety.\\nWorking with suppliers can speed up product development time significantly.\\nThis is crucial in an era when product life cycles are shrinking and bringing a product to market before the competition offers a significant advantage.\\nFinally, integrating the supplier into the design phase allows the manufacturer to focus on system integration, resulting in a higher quality product at lower cost.\\nFor example, auto manufacturers are increasingly playing the role of system integrators rather than component designers.\\nThis is an approach that has been used even more extensively in the high-tech industry.\\nBillington and Jager (2008) provide an excellent example of innovation through collaboration.\\nThey discuss Goldcorp Inc., one of the world\\'s largest gold producers, whose mines were performing poorly.\\nThe company broadcast its entire geological data record and offered companies a prize for the most effective way of mining the gold.\\nTwo Australian companies collaborated to come up with a three-dimensional depiction of the mine.\\nThe 3D data allowed Goldcorp to improve production from 53,000 ounces at a cost of $360 an ounce in 1996 to 504,000 ounces at a cost of $59 per ton in 2001.\\nThe risk that Goldcorp took when sharing its data with potential suppliers clearly paid off handsomely.\\nAs suppliers take on a bigger design role, it is important for manufacturers also to become design coordinators for the supply chain.\\nCommon part descriptions should be available to all parties involved in the design, and any design changes by one party should be communicated to all suppliers affected.\\nA good database of existing parts and designs can save significant amounts of money and time.\\nFor example, when Johnson Controls finds a seat frame from its database that fulfills all customer requirements, it saves the customer about $20 million on the design, development, tooling, and prototyping expense.\\nA survey by the Procurement and Supply Chain Benchmarking Consortium at Michigan State University dramatically demonstrated the impact of successfully integrating suppliers in product design.\\nThe most successful integration efforts have seen costs decrease by 20 percent, quality improve by 30 percent, and time to market decrease by 50 percent.\\nKey themes that must be communicated to suppliers as they take greater responsibility for design are design for logistics and design for manufacturability.\\nDesign for logistics attempts to reduce transportation, handling, and inventory costs during distribution by taking appropriate actions during design.\\nTo reduce transportation and handling costs, the manufacturer must convey expected order sizes from retailers and the end consumer to the designer.\\nPackages can then be designed so that transportation costs are lowered and handling is minimized.\\nTo reduce transportation cost, packaging is kept as compact as possible and is also designed to ensure easy stacking.\\nTo reduce handling costs, package sizes are designed to minimize the need to break open a pack to fulfill an order.\\nTo reduce inventory costs, the primary approach is to design the product for postponement and mass customization (see Chapters 12 and 13).\\nPostponement strategies aim to design a product and production process so that features that differentiate end products are introduced late in the manufacturing phase.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 12, Dell designed its PCs so that all components about which customers have a choice are assembled after the customer order arrives.\\nThis allowed Dell to lower inventories by aggregating them as components.\\nMass customization strategies use a similar approach by designing the product so that inventory can be carried in a form that aggregates across multiple end products.\\nThe goal is to design a product so that customization occurs along a combination of three customization categories: modular, adjustable, and dimensional.\\nTo provide modular customization, the product is designed as an assembly of modules that fit together.\\nAll inventory is then maintained as modules that are assembled to order.\\nA good example of modular customization is the design of tables and bookshelves at IKEA, where the customer typically assembles the modules.\\nAn example of adjustable customization is a washing machine designed by Matsushita that can automatically select from among 600 cycles.\\nAll inventory is thus maintained as a single product, and each customer uses the machine to match its specific needs.\\nAn example of dimensional customization given by Joseph Pine (1999) is a machine that makes onsite custom house gutters that can then be cut to fit the dimensions of the house.\\nAnother example is National Bicycle, which cuts the frame tubing to fit the body size of the customer.\\nDesign for manufacturability attempts to design products for ease of manufacture.\\nSome of the key principles used include part commonality, eliminating right-hand and left-hand parts, designing symmetrical parts, combining parts, using catalog parts rather than designing a new part, and designing parts to provide access for other parts and tools.\\nKey Point Design collaboration with suppliers can help a firm reduce cost, improve quality, and decrease time to market.\\nAs design responsibility moves to suppliers, it is important to ensure that design for logistics and design for manufacturability principles are followed.\\nTo be successful, manufacturers must become effective design coordinators in the supply chain.\\nA good area in which to view design collaboration efforts is the automotive industry.\\nCar manufacturers all over the world are asking suppliers to participate in every aspect of product development, from conceptual design to manufacturing.\\nFord asked suppliers for the Thunderbird not only to manufacture the components and subsystems, but also to be responsible for their design.\\nSolid integration throughout the supply chain allowed Ford to bring the new model to market within 36 months of program approval.\\nTo ensure effective communication, Ford required all its vendors to be on the same software platform for design.\\nFord also opened all its internal databases to its suppliers and located many of the suppliers at its offices.\\nFord engineers were in constant communication with the suppliers and helped coordinate the overall design.\\nThe result was a significant improvement in cost, time, and quality.\\nOnce suppliers have been selected, contracts are in place, and the product has been designed, the buyer and suppliers engage in procurement transactions that begin with the buyer placing the order and end with the buyer receiving and paying for the order.\\nIn designing the procurement process, it is important to consider goods that the process will be used to purchase.\\nThere are two main categories of purchased goods: direct and indirect materials.\\nDirect materials are components used to make finished goods.\\nFor example, memory, hard drives, and CD drives are direct materials for a PC manufacturer.\\nIndirect materials are goods used to support the operations of a firm.\\nPCs are examples of indirect materials for an automotive manufacturer.\\nAll procurement processes within a company relate to the purchase of direct and indirect materials.\\nImportant differences between direct and indirect materials that affect procurement are shown in Table 15-7.\\nGiven the direct link to production, the procurement process for direct materials should be designed to ensure that components are available in the right place, in the right quantity, and at the right time.\\nThe primary goal of the procurement process for direct materials is to coordinate the entire supply chain and ensure matching of supply and demand (as discussed in Chapters 9 and 10).\\nThe procurement process should thus be designed to make production plans and current levels of component inventory at the manufacturer visible to the supplier.\\nThis visibility allows suppliers to schedule component production to match the needs of the manufacturer.\\nThe available capacity at the suppliers should be made visible to the manufacturer so that orders for components may be allocated to the appropriate supplier to ensure on-time delivery.\\nThe procurement process should also have alerts built into it that warn both the buyer and the supplier of potential mismatches between supply and demand.\\nA good example of a procurement process that focuses on these objectives is the eHub initiative at Cisco.\\neHub is designed to provide synchronized planning and end-to-end supply chain visibility.\\nAnother example is the relationship between Johnson Controls and Chrysler for the 2002 Jeep Liberty.\\nJohnson Controls integrated components from 35 suppliers and delivered the assembly to Chrysler as a cockpit module.\\nAs soon as Chrysler notified it of an order for a Jeep, Johnson Controls had 204 minutes in which to build and deliver the module.\\nThis was done 900 times every day for about 200 color and interior combinations.\\nThe focus of the procurement process was to completely synchronize production at Chrysler and Johnson Controls.\\nThe result was a significant reduction in inventory and a better matching of product supply with end customer demand.\\nGiven the focus on numerous low-value transactions, the procurement process for indirect materials should focus on reducing the transaction cost of each order.\\nTransaction costs for indirect materials are high because of the difficulty of selecting goods (many catalogs, which are often out of date), getting approval, and creating and sending a purchase order.\\nThe problem is  Table 15-7 Differences Between Direct and Indirect Materials  Direct Materials  Indirect Materials  Use Accounting Impact on production Processing cost relative to value of transaction Number of transactions  Production Cost of goods sold Any delay will delay production Low Low  Maintenance, repair, and support operations Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) Less direct impact High High  .\\noften exaggerated because companies do not have one system for indirect materials.\\nInstead, they use several processes that are not streamlined or integrated.\\nA good online procurement process that makes search easy and automates approval and transmission of the purchase order can help reduce transaction costs.\\nThe online process should also update other interested parties such as accounts payable and receiving.\\nClearly this is possible only with suppliers that implement online catalogs and automate all transactions with the buyer.\\nSuccessful examples of online procurement implementations for indirect materials include Johnson Controls and Pfizer.\\nBoth firms built their online solutions by integrating existing software.\\nJohnson Controls integrated a Commerce One solution with existing Oracle accounting software, whereas Pfizer integrated an Ariba system with an American Express corporate purchasing card program.\\nBoth claim to have seen significant savings as a result.\\nAnother important requirement for the procurement process for both direct and indirect materials is the ability to aggregate orders by product and supplier.\\nFor direct materials, the consolidation of orders improves economies of scale at the supplier and during transport and allows the firm to take advantage of any quantity discounts that may be offered by the supplier.\\nFor indirect materials, the consolidation of spending with a supplier often allows the firm to negotiate better purchasing discounts.\\nKey Point The procurement process for direct materials should focus on improving coordination and visibility with the supplier.\\nThe procurement process for indirect materials should focus on decreasing the transaction cost for each order.\\nThe procurement process in both cases should consolidate orders to take advantage of economies of scale and quantity discounts.\\nIn addition to the categorization of materials into direct and indirect, all products purchased may also be categorized as shown in Figure 15-2, based on their value/cost and how critical they are.\\nMost indirect materials are included in general items.\\nThe goal of procurement in this case should be to lower the cost of acquisition or the transaction cost.\\nDirect materials can be further classified into bulk purchase, critical, and strategic items.\\nFor most bulk purchase items, such as packaging materials and bulk chemicals, suppliers tend to have the same selling price.\\nIt is thus important for purchasing to make a distinction between suppliers based on the services they High  Critical Items  Strategic Items  Critical  General Items  Bulk Purchase Items  Low Low  Value/Cost  High  .\\nprovide and their performance along all dimensions that affect the total cost of ownership.\\nThe use of well-designed auctions is likely to be most effective for bulk purchase items.\\nCritical items include components with long lead times and specialty chemicals.\\nThe key sourcing objective for critical items is not low price but ensuring availability.\\nIn this case, purchasing should work to improve coordination of production plans at both the buyer and the supplier.\\nThe presence of a responsive, even if high-cost, supply source as an alternative can be valuable for critical items.\\nThe last category, strategic items, includes examples such as electronics for an auto manufacturer.\\nFor strategic items, the buyer-supplier relationship is long term.\\nThus suppliers should be evaluated based on the lifetime cost/value of the relationship.\\nPurchasing should look for suppliers that can collaborate in the design phase and coordinate design and production activities with other players in the supply chain.\\nWhen structuring a supplier portfolio, firms have many options with regard to whom to source from and where to source from.\\nWith regard to the \"whom,\" a company must decide on whether to produce in-house or outsource to a third party.\\nThe company must also decide whether the supply source will be cost efficient or responsive.\\nWith regard to the \"where,\" a company can choose between onshoring, near-shoring, and offshoring.\\nOnshoring refers to producing the product in the market where it is sold, even when it is a high-cost location.\\nNear-shoring refers to producing the product at a lower cost location near the market.\\nFor the U.S. market, producing in Mexico is near-shoring.\\nFor the market in Europe, producing in Eastern Europe is near-shoring.\\nOffshoring refers to producing the product at a low-cost location that may be far from the market.\\nIn this section, we discuss a variety of factors that influence the design of the sourcing portfolio.\\nMost companies need to tailor their supplier portfolio based on a variety of product and market characteristics.\\nFor example, Zara uses responsive sources out of Europe to produce trendy products that must be in stores quickly to meet customer demand.\\nIn contrast, basics such as a white t-shirt are sourced out of lower-cost facilities in Asia.\\nTable 15-8 identifies factors that favor the selection of a responsive or low-cost source.\\nAs with Zara, a tailored portfolio consists of a combination of responsive and low-cost suppliers.\\nTo use a tailored portfolio effectively, demand should be allocated among suppliers in a way that is consistent with their capabilities.\\nLow-cost suppliers should be given large, steady orders of mature, low-value products that do not require significant engineering or design support.\\nResponsive suppliers, in contrast, should be responsible for high-value, volatile products that are often early in their life cycle and need significant engineering/design support.\\nIn general, responsive sources will tend to be located onshore or near-shore to facilitate a quick response.\\nLow-cost sources could be located anywhere but low cost is often the main reason for going offshore or near-shore.\\nIn Table 15-9, we identify some factors that influence the sourcing location decision.\\nTable 15-8 Factors Favoring Selection of a Responsive or Low-Cost Source  Responsive Source  Low-Cost Source  Product life cycle Demand volatility Demand volume Product value Rate of product obsolescence Desired quality Engineering / design support  Early phase High Low High High High High  Mature phase Low High Low Low Low to medium Low  .\\nTable 15-9 Factors Favoring Onshoring, Near-shoring, or Offshoring  Onshore Near-shore  Offshore  Rate of innovation/product variety Demand volatility Labor content Volume or weight-to-value ratio Impact of supply chain disruption Inventory costs Engineering/management support  High High Low High High High High  Medium to High Medium to High Medium to High High Medium to High Medium to High High  Low Low High Low Low Low Low  Large, bulky items such as washing machines and refrigerators are best onshored or nearshored because they have high transportation costs relative to value.\\nIn contrast, small items like consumer electronics, especially those that sell in large amounts (say the iPad), can be offshored.\\nAs transportation costs increase, the onshore and near-shore options become more attractive relative to offshoring.\\nHigh-value routers with high demand volatility, high inventory costs, and the need for significant management support are outsourced by Cisco to an onshore supplier.\\nLow value routers with stable designs and low demand volatility, in contrast, are offshored to low-cost countries.\\nAs these examples illustrate, it is important for a firm to plan a tailored sourcing strategy whereby the product and market characteristics match with the responsiveness and location of the source.\\nChina and other parts of Asia were popular offshore sources for the two decades between 1990 and 2010.\\nSome trends currently in place, however, are making American managers rethink their offshoring choices.\\nOne is the change in Chinese wages and the strengthening yuan, both of which diminish the labor cost advantage of China, especially when compared to near-shore locations such as Mexico.\\nThe other is the increase in oil prices and transportation cost that acts like a tariff barrier making offshoring somewhat less attractive.\\nFinally, the increase in volatility and the need to mitigate risk have also encouraged supply chain designers to include an onshore or near-shore source to complement a low-cost offshore source.\\nKey Point Firms must consider a tailored sourcing strategy that couples responsive onshore or near-shore sources with low-cost offshore sources.\\nThe responsive onshore sources should focus on high-value products with high demand volatility, while the low-cost, offshore sources should focus on lower-value, high-volume products with high labor content.\\nSourcing risks may result in an inability to meet demand on time, an increase in procurement costs, or the loss of intellectual property.\\nIt is important to develop mitigation strategies that help mitigate a significant part of the risk.\\nAn inability to meet demand on time arises because of disruption or delay from the supply source.\\nThe risk of supply disruption may be serious, especially with a single or few sources.\\nThis was particularly evident after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early 2011.\\nSupply chains with a single source based in the tsunami-affected region faced significant disruption.\\nDisruption risk can be mitigated by developing multiple sources.\\nGiven the high cost of developing multiple sources and the resulting loss of economies of scale, it is best to do so for products with relatively high demand.\\nDeveloping multiple sources is expensive for products with low demand.\\nCarrying inventory or developing a backup source that is more responsive can mitigate delays from a supply source.\\nCarrying inventory is best for low-value products that do not become obsolete quickly, whereas developing a responsive backup source is preferred for high-value, short life cycle products.\\nThe risk of higher procurement costs can be significant when industry-wide demand for the product exceeds available supply, exchange rates are unfavorable, or there is a single supply source.\\nFor example, commodity prices for steel and crude oil were very high in 2004?005 because of high global demand in the face of limited supply capacity.\\nA portfolio of long- and short-term contracts can help mitigate the risk of higher procurement costs.\\nFor example, a significant contributor to the profits at Southwest Airlines in 2004?005 was the long-term contracts it had in place for the purchase of fuel.\\nExchange-rate risk can be mitigated using financial hedges or by developing a global supply network that is flexible enough to be reconfigured based on exchange-rate fluctuations.\\nThe risk of holdup because of a single source can be countered by developing alternative sources or bringing part of the supply capability in-house.\\nIntellectual property risk can be mitigated by bringing or keeping sensitive production in-house.\\nEven when production is outsourced, firms can maintain ownership of part of the equipment if it is viewed as having significant intellectual property value.\\nThis is a reason that Motorola owns some testing equipment at its contract manufacturers.\\nUse multifunctional teams.\\nEffective strategies for sourcing result from multifunctional collaboration within the firm.\\nA sourcing strategy from the purchasing group is likely to be relatively narrow and focus on purchase price.\\nA strategy developed with the collaboration of purchasing, manufacturing, engineering, and planning is much more likely to identify the correct drivers of total cost.\\nThe collaboration must be continued beyond strategy formulation to the procurement phase, because that is where manufacturing and engineering are most likely to realize the full benefits of good sourcing strategy.\\nEnsure appropriate coordination across regions and business units.\\nCoordination of purchasing across all regions and business units allows a firm to maximize economies of scale in purchasing and also to reduce transaction costs.\\nOther opportunities from improved sourcing, such as better supply chain coordination and design collaboration, however, may require strong involvement at the business-unit level to be effective.\\nMandating global coordination across all business units may complicate these efforts.\\nItems such as MRO supplies, for which transaction costs and total purchase volume have a significant impact on total cost, benefit most from coordinated purchasing across geography and business units.\\nOn the other hand, items for which most of the value is extracted from better design collaboration and coordinated supply chain forecasting and fulfillment are better served with somewhat more decentralized sourcing.\\nAlways evaluate the total cost of ownership.\\nAn effective sourcing strategy should not make price reduction its sole objective.\\nAll factors that influence the total cost of ownership should be identified and used in selecting suppliers.\\nSupplier performance along all relevant dimensions should be measured, and its impact on total cost should be quantified.\\nFocusing on the total cost of ownership also allows a buyer to better identify opportunities for better collaboration in design, planning, and fulfillment.\\nBuild long-term relationships with key suppliers.\\nA basic principle of good sourcing is that a buyer and supplier working together can generate more opportunities for savings than the two parties working independently.\\nSolid cooperation is likely to result only when the two parties have a long-term relationship and a degree of trust.\\nA long-term relationship encourages the supplier to expend greater effort on issues that are important to a particular buyer.\\nThis includes investment in buyer-specific technology and design collaboration.\\nA long-term relationship also improves communication and coordination between the two parties.\\nThese capabilities are very important when sourcing direct materials.\\nThus, long-term relationships should be nurtured with suppliers of critical and strategic direct materials.\\nUnderstand the role of sourcing in a supply chain.\\nSourcing encompasses all processes required for a firm to purchase goods from suppliers.\\nOver the past two decades, manufacturing firms have increased the fraction of purchased parts.\\nEffective sourcing decisions thus have a significant impact on financial performance.\\nGood sourcing decisions can improve supply chain performance by aggregating orders, making procurement transactions more efficient, achieving design collaboration with suppliers, facilitating coordinated forecasting and planning with suppliers, designing supply chain contracts that increase profitability while minimizing information distortion, and decreasing the purchase price through increased competition among suppliers.\\nDiscuss factors that affect the decision to outsource a supply chain function.\\nA supply chain function should be outsourced if the third party can increase the supply chain surplus without significant risk.\\nA third party may increase the surplus by aggregating capacity, inventory, warehousing, transportation, information, receivables, and other factors to a higher level than the firm can on its own.\\nOutsourcing generally makes sense if a firm\\'s needs are small and highly uncertain and can be served using resources that can serve other firms as well.\\nOutsourcing also makes sense if the firm is short of capital or the third party has a lower cost of capital.\\nIdentify dimensions of supplier performance that affect total cost.\\nIn addition to the supplier price, the total cost of using a supplier is affected by the supplier terms; delivery costs; inventory costs; warehousing costs; quality costs; costs of management effort and administrative support; impact on reputation; supplier capabilities, such as replenishment lead time, on-time performance, and flexibility; and other costs such as exchange rate trends, taxes, and duties.\\nStructure successful auctions and negotiations.\\nBuyers may use sealed-bid firstprice, Dutch, English, or second-price (Vickrey) auctions.\\nSuccessful auctions minimize the cost for the buyer and result in the lowest-cost supplier winning the bid.\\nUnder many circumstances, open English auctions achieve this outcome.\\nWhen running an auction, buyers must work to avoid collusion among bidders.\\nSuccessful negotiations are most likely when both parties are well informed about each other\\'s positions and have multiple dimensions they can use to increase the size of the pie, resulting in a win-win outcome.\\nDescribe the impact of risk sharing on supplier performance and information distortion.\\nSupply contracts must take into account the desired objective of the buyer and supplier and the resulting impact on supply chain performance.\\nContracts can be designed to increase product availability, coordinate supply chain costs, increase agent effort, and induce performance improvement from the supplier.\\nContracts to increase product availability include buyback, revenue-sharing, and quantity flexibility contracts.\\nThey are designed to counter the problem of double marginalization.\\nBuyback and revenue-sharing contracts increase information distortion relative to quantity flexibility contracts.\\nQuantity discounts coordinate supply chain costs when the supplier has significant fixed costs per lot.\\nQuantity discounts increase information distortion because of order batching.\\nTwo-part tariffs and threshold contracts are designed to increase agent effort.\\nThreshold contracts can significantly increase information distortion and are best implemented over a rolling horizon.\\nSharedsavings contracts are most effective when a buyer wants the supplier to improve performance along dimensions such as lead time and quality.\\nDesign a tailored supplier portfolio.\\nFirms should select a combination of responsive and low-cost sources that may be onshore, near-shore, or offshore.\\nResponsive, onshore sources are best suited for high-value products with volatile demand and relatively low labor content.\\nLow-cost, offshore sources are best suited for products with high labor content, large predictable demand, and low transportation cost relative to product value.\\n Understand the role of revenue management in a supply chain.\\nIdentify conditions under which revenue management tactics can be effective.\\nDescribe trade-offs that must be considered when making revenue management decisions.\\nGiven that most supply chain assets are fixed but demand fluctuates, the matching of supply and demand is a constant challenge.\\nIn this chapter, we discuss how managers may use pricing as a lever to better match supply and demand and grow revenue derived from supply chain assets.\\nConsider a trucking company that owns 10 trucks.\\nOne approach that the firm can take is to set a fixed price for its services and use advertising to spur demand in case surplus capacity is available.\\nUsing revenue management, however, the firm could do much more as long as there are customers whose willingness to pay varies with some dimension of the service such as response time.\\nOne approach is to charge a lower price to customers willing to commit their orders far in advance and a higher price to customers looking for transportation capacity at the last minute.\\nAnother approach is to charge a lower price to customers with long-term contracts and a higher price to customers looking to purchase capacity at the last minute.\\nA third approach is to charge a higher price during periods of high demand and lower prices during periods of low demand.\\nConsider a retailer that purchases seasonal apparel for sale.\\nA strategy that adjusts prices based on product availability, customer demand, and remaining duration of the sales season will result in higher supply chain profits than a strategy that fixes price for the duration of the sales season.\\nAll of these revenue management strategies use differential pricing as a critical lever to maximize earnings.\\nRevenue management may also be defined as the use of differential pricing based on customer segment, time of use, and product or capacity availability to increase supply chain surplus and profits.\\nThe impact of revenue management on supply chain performance can be significant.\\nOne of the most often cited examples is the successful use of revenue management by American Airlines to counter and finally defeat PeopleExpress in the mid-1980s.\\nPeopleExpress started in Newark, New Jersey, and offered fares that were 50 to 80 percent lower than those of other carriers.\\nAt first, the other airlines ignored PeopleExpress because they were not interested in the low-fare market segment.\\nBy 1983, however, PeopleExpress was flying 40 aircraft and achieving load factors of more than 74 percent.\\nPeopleExpress and other new entrants were making significant inroads into the turf of existing airlines.\\nThe existing airlines could not compete by cutting prices to the level of PeopleExpress because they had higher operating costs.\\nAmerican Airlines was the first to come up with an effective countermeasure using revenue management.\\nRather than lower the price of all its seats, American lowered prices of a portion of the seats to prices at or below those of PeopleExpress.\\nThe number of low-price seats was larger on flights likely to have empty seats, which would otherwise have produced no revenue.\\nThis strategy allowed American to attract customers who valued the low prices without losing revenue from customers who were willing to pay more.\\nSoon other airlines, such as United, followed suit, attracting many of PeopleExpress\\'s passengers.\\nThis was sufficient to drive down load factors for PeopleExpress to below 50 percent, a level at which the airline could not survive.\\nBefore the end of 1986, PeopleExpress collapsed.\\nAmerican Airlines succeeded primarily because it used differential pricing to lower prices for a fraction of the seats and attract passengers who would otherwise have flown PeopleExpress.\\nAmerican did not lower prices for the fraction of seats used by business travelers who were not flying with PeopleExpress.\\nTargeted differential pricing is at the heart of successful revenue management.\\nRevenue management adjusts the pricing and available supply of assets and has a significant impact on supply chain profitability when one or more of the following four conditions exist: 1.\\nThe value of the product varies in different market segments.\\nThe product is highly perishable or product wastage occurs.\\nDemand has seasonal and other peaks.\\nThe product is sold both in bulk and on the spot market.\\nAirline seats are a good example of a product whose value varies by market segment.\\nA business traveler is willing to pay a higher fare for a flight that matches his or her schedule.\\nIn contrast, a leisure traveler will often alter his or her schedule to get a lower fare.\\nAn airline that can extract a higher price from the business traveler compared to the leisure traveler will always do better than an airline that charges the same price to all travelers.\\nSimilar ideas can be applied in the context of hotel rooms and car rentals, for which there is a significant difference between the business traveler and the leisure traveler.\\nFashion and seasonal apparel are examples of highly perishable products because they lose value over time.\\nCustomers typically value high-fashion apparel more at the start of the season because they want to be the first people seen wearing it.\\nBy the end of the season, customers are willing to buy the product only if it is deeply discounted.\\nSimilarly, production, storage, and transportation capacity loses all value if it is not used at a given time because the lost capacity cannot be recovered.\\nIf a truck is not used for a day, its transportation capacity for that day is gone forever without producing revenue.\\nThus, all capacity is also a highly perishable asset.\\nThe goal of revenue management in such a setting is to adjust the price over time to maximize the profit obtained from the available inventory or capacity.\\nDemand for hotel rooms in many tourist destinations shows a highly seasonal pattern.\\nFor example, resorts in Phuket, Thailand, charge a significantly lower rate during the off-season summer months compared to the peak winter months.\\nSuch a pricing pattern allows them to attract customers with some time flexibility during the lower-cost summer months, leaving the winter capacity for customers who are willing to pay more to enjoy Phuket in the winter.\\nSome commuter railroads use a similar strategy to deal with the distinct peaks in passenger travel.\\nThey charge higher fares during peak periods and lower fares for off-peak travel.\\nIt is important to keep in mind that differential pricing for peak and off-peak periods increases profits in a manner that is consistent with customer priorities.\\nIn the absence of peak pricing, peak periods, being the most desirable, would have excess demand, whereas off-peak periods would have significant idle capacity.\\nWith differential pricing, customers who really value the peak period would pay the higher price, whereas those that were not time constrained would shift to the offpeak period to take advantage of lower prices.\\nThe outcome of such a move is a higher supply chain surplus with higher profits for the firm and a utilization of assets by customers that is consistent with their needs.\\nEvery product and every unit of capacity can be sold both in bulk and in the spot market.\\nFor example, the owner of a warehouse must decide whether to lease the entire warehouse to customers willing to sign long-term contracts or to save a portion of the warehouse for use in the spot market.\\nThe long-term contract is more secure but typically fetches a lower average price than the unpredictable spot market.\\nRevenue management increases profits by finding the right portfolio of long-term and spot-market customers.\\nRevenue management can be a powerful tool for every owner of assets in a supply chain.\\nOwners of any form of capacity (production, transportation, or storage) can use revenue management if there is seasonal demand or if there are segments that are willing to pay different prices for different lead times to use the capacity.\\nRevenue management can be effective if a segment wants to use capacity at the last minute and is willing to pay a higher price for this privilege, and another segment wants a lower price and is willing to commit far in advance.\\nRevenue management is essential for owners of any perishable inventory.\\nMost successful examples of the use of revenue management are from the travel and hospitality industry and include airlines, car rentals, and hotels.\\nAmerican Airlines has stated that revenue management techniques increase its revenues by more than $1 billion each year.\\nRevenue management techniques at Marriott raise annual revenues by more than $100 million.\\nRevenue management can have a similar impact on all stages of a supply chain that satisfy one or more of the four conditions identified earlier.\\nIn the following sections, we discuss various situations in which revenue management is effective and the techniques used in each case.\\nA classic example of a market with multiple customer segments is the airline industry, wherein business travelers are willing to pay a higher fare to travel a specific schedule, whereas leisure travelers are willing to shift their schedule to take advantage of lower fares.\\nMany similar instances arise in a supply chain.\\nConsider ToFrom, a trucking firm that has purchased six trucks,  .\\nwith a total capacity of 6,000 cubic feet, to use for transport between Chicago and St. Louis.\\nThe monthly lease charge, driver, and maintenance expense is $1,500 per truck.\\nMarket research has indicated that the demand curve for trucking capacity is d = 10,000 - 2,000p where d is the demand across all segments and p is the transport cost per cubic foot.\\nA price of $2 per cubic foot results in a demand of 6,000 cubic feet (all customers willing to pay $2 or more), revenue of $12,000, and a profit of $3,000, whereas a price of $3.50 per cubic foot results in a demand of 3,000 (only those customers willing to pay $3.50 or more), revenue of $10,500, and a profit of $1,500.\\nThe real question is whether the 3,000 cubic feet of demand at a price of $3.50 can be separated from the 3,000 additional cubic feet of demand generated at a price of $2 per cubic foot.\\nIf ToFrom assumes that all demand comes from a single segment and cannot be separated, the optimal price is $2.50 per cubic foot, resulting in a demand of 5,000 cubic feet and revenue of $12,500, as shown in Figure 16-1.\\nHowever, if ToFrom can differentiate the segment that buys 3,000 cubic feet at $3.50 from the segment that buys 3,000 cubic feet only at $2.00, the firm can use revenue management to improve revenues and profits.\\nToFrom should charge $3.50 for the segment willing to pay that price and $2.00 for the 3,000 cubic feet that sells only at that price.\\nThe firm thus extracts revenue of $10,500 from the segment willing to pay $3.50 and revenue of $6,000 from the segment willing to pay only $2.00 per cubic foot for total revenue of $16,500, as shown in Figure 16-2.\\nIn the presence of different segments that have different values for trucking capacity, revenue management increases the revenue from $12,500 to $16,500 and results in a significant improvement in profits.\\nIn theory, the concept of differential pricing increases total profits for a firm.\\nTwo fundamental issues, however, must be handled in practice.\\nFirst, how can the firm differentiate between the two segments and structure its pricing to make one segment pay more than the other?\\nSecond, how can the firm control demand such that the lower-paying segment does not utilize the entire availability of the asset?\\nTo differentiate between the various segments, the firm must create barriers by identifying product or service attributes that the segments value differently.\\nFor example, business travelers on an airline want to book at the last minute and stay only as long as they must.\\nDemand  12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 5,000 4,000 2,000 0 0 1 2 $2.50 3 4 Price .\\n12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 0 0 1 2 3 $3.50 4 5 6 Price .\\nLeisure travelers, on the other hand, are willing to book far in advance and adjust the duration of their stay.\\nPlans for business travelers are also subject to change.\\nThus, advance booking, a required Saturday-night stay, and a penalty for changes on the lower fare separate the leisure traveler from the business traveler.\\nFor a transportation provider such as ToFrom, the segments can be differentiated based on how far in advance a customer is willing to commit and pay for the transportation capacity.\\nSimilar separation can also occur for production- and storagerelated assets in a supply chain.\\nIn the presence of multiple segments that can be separated, the firm must solve the following two problems: 1.\\nWhat price to charge each segment?\\nHow to allocate limited capacity among the segments?\\nPricing to Multiple Segments Let us start by considering the simple scenario in which the firm has identified criteria on which it can separate the various customer segments.\\nOne such criterion may be an airline requiring a Saturday-night stay over.\\nAnother might be a trucking company separating customers based on the advance notice with which they are willing to commit to a shipment.\\nThe firm now wishes to identify the appropriate price for each segment.\\nConsider a supplier (of product or some other supply chain function) that has identified k distinct customer segments that can be separated.\\nAssume that the demand curve for segment i is given by (we assume linear demand curves to simplify the analysis) di = Ai - Bipi The supplier has a cost c of production per unit and must decide on the price pi to charge each segment; di is the resulting demand from segment i.\\nThe goal of the supplier is to price so as to maximize its profits.\\nThe pricing problem can be formulated as follows: k Max a (pi - c)(Ai - Bipi) i=1  .\\nWithout a capacity constraint, the problem separates by segment, and for segment i, the supplier attempts to maximize  (pi - c)(Ai - Bipi)  The optimal price for each segment i is given by  pi =  Ai 2Bi  +  c 2  .\\nIf the available capacity is constrained by Q, the optimal prices are obtained by solving  subject to  k Max a (pi - c)(Ai - Bipi) i=1 k a (Ai - Bipi) ... Q i=1 Ai - Bipi ?0 for i = 1, ?, k  .\\nBoth formulations are simple enough to be solved in Excel.\\nExample 16-1 illustrates the benefit of differential prices to multiple segments.\\nEXAMPLE 16-1 Pricing to Multiple Segments  A contract manufacturer has identified two customer segments for its production capacity-- one willing to place an order more than one week in advance and the other willing to pay a higher price as long as it can provide less than one week\\'s notice for production.\\nThe customers that are unwilling to commit in advance are less price sensitive and have a demand curve d1 = 5,000 - 20p1.\\nCustomers willing to commit in advance are more price sensitive and have a demand curve of d2 = 5,000 - 40p1.\\nProduction cost is c = $10 per unit.\\nWhat price should the contract manufacturer charge each segment if its goal is to maximize profits?\\nIf the contract manufacturer were to charge a single price over both segments, what should it be?\\nHow much increase in profits does differential pricing provide?\\nIf total production capacity is limited to 4,000 units, what should the contract manufacturer charge each segment?\\n5,000 p1 = 2 * 20  + 10 2  = 125 + 5 = $130  and  5,000 p2 = 2 * 40  + 10 2  = 62.5 + 5 = $67.5  The demand from the two segments is given by  d1 = 5,000 - 20 * 130 = 2,400 and d2 = 5,000 - 40 * 67.5 = 2,300  The total profit is  Total profit = 130 * 2,400 + 67.5 * 2,300 - 10 * 4,700 = $420,250  If the contract manufacturer charges the same price p to both segments, he is attempting to maximize (p - 10)(5,000 - 20p) + (p - 10)(5,000 - 40p) = (p - 10)(10,000 - 60p)  .\\nThe optimal price in this case is given by  p=  10,000 2 * 60  +  10 2  = $88.33  The demand from the two segments is given by  d1 = 5,000 - 20 * 88.33 = 3,233.40 and d2 = 5,000 - 40 * 88.33 = 1,466.80  The total profit is  Total profit = (88.33 - 10) * (3,233.40 + 1,466.80) = $368,166.67  Differential pricing thus raises the profits by more than $50,000 relative to offering a fixed price.\\nNow let us consider the case in which total production capacity is limited to 4,000 units.\\nMax (p1 - 10)(5,000 - 20p1) + (p2 - 10)(5,000 - 40p2)  Subject to  (5,000 - 20p1) + (5,000 - 40p2) ... 4,000 (5,000 - 20p1), (5,000 - 40p2) ?0  The results of the constrained optimization are shown in Figure 16-3.\\nObserve that the limited capacity leads the contract manufacturer to charge a higher price to each of the two segments relative to when there was no capacity limit.\\nThe methodology we have described has two important assumptions that are unlikely to hold in practice.\\nThe first assumption is that nobody from the higher-price segment decides to shift to the lower-price segment after prices are announced.\\nIn other words, we have assumed that the attribute such as lead time used to separate the segments works perfectly.\\nIn practice, this is unlikely to be the case.\\nOur second assumption is that once prices are decided, customer demand is predictable.\\nIn practice, uncertainty will always be associated with demand.\\nTalluri and Van Ryzin (2004) have an excellent discussion of several models for revenue management that account for uncertainty and a few models that account for customers being strategic and deciding on their actions after prices are announced.\\nAllocating Capacity to a Segment Under Uncertainty In most instances of differential pricing, demand from the segment paying the lower price arises earlier in time than demand from the segment paying the higher price.\\nA supplier may charge a lower price to a buyer willing to commit far in advance and a higher price to buyers wanting to place their orders at the last minute.\\nTo take advantage of revenue management, the supplier must limit the amount of capacity committed to lower-price buyers even if sufficient demand exists from the lower-price segment to use the entire available capacity.\\nThis raises the question of how much capacity to save for the higher-price segment.\\nThe answer would be simple if demand were predictable.\\nIn practice, demand is uncertain and firms must make this decision taking uncertainty into account.\\nThe basic trade-off to be considered by the supplier with production capacity is between committing to an order from a lower-price buyer or waiting for a higher-price buyer to arrive later on.\\nThe two risks in such a situation are spoilage and spill.\\nSpoilage occurs when the capacity reserved for higher-price buyers is wasted because demand from the higher-price segment does not materialize.\\nSpill occurs if higher-price buyers have to be turned away because the capacity has already been committed to lower-price buyers.\\nThe supplier should decide on the capacity to commit for the higher-price buyers so as to minimize the expected cost of spoilage and spill.\\nA current order from a lower-price buyer should be compared with the expected revenue from waiting for a higher-price buyer.\\nThe order from the lower-price buyer should be accepted if the expected revenue from the higher-price buyer is lower than the current revenue from the lower-price buyer.\\nWe now develop this trade-off in terms of a formula that can be used when the supplier is working with two customer segments.\\nLet pL be the price charged to the lower-price segment and pH be the price charged to the higher-price segment.\\nAssume that the anticipated demand for the higher-price segment is normally distributed, with a mean of DH and a standard deviation of sH.\\nIf we reserve a capacity CH for the higher-price segment, the expected marginal revenue RH(CH) from reserving more capacity is given by RH(CH) = Prob (demand from higher-price segment 7 CH) * pH The reserved quantity for the higher-price segment should be chosen so that the expected marginal revenue from the higher-price segment equals the current marginal revenue from the lower-price segment; that is, RH(CH) = pL.\\nIn other words, the quantity CH reserved for the higher-price segment should be such that  Prob (demand from higher-price segment 7 CH) = pL>pH  .\\nIf demand for the higher-price segment is normally distributed, with a mean of DH and a standard deviation of sH we can obtain the quantity reserved for the higher-price segment as  CH = F-1(1 - pL>pH, DH, sH) = NORMINV(1 - pL>pH, DH, sH)  .\\nIf there are more than two customer segments, the same philosophy can be used to obtain a set of nested reservations.\\nThe quantity C1 reserved for the highest-price segment should be such that the expected marginal revenue from the highest-priced segment equals the price of the next-highest-priced segment.\\nThe quantity C2 reserved for the two highest-priced segments should be such that the expected marginal revenue from the two highest-priced segments equals the price of the third-highest-priced segment.\\nThis sequential approach can be used to obtain a set of nested reservations of capacity for all but the lowest-priced segment.\\nAn important point to observe is that the use of differential pricing increases the level of asset availability for the high-priced segment.\\nCapacity is being saved for these customers because of their willingness to pay more for the asset.\\nThus, effective use of revenue management increases firm profits and also improves service for the more valuable customer segment.\\nExample 16-2 illustrates how profits can be increased by reserving capacity for the higher paying segment.\\nEXAMPLE 16-2 Allocating Capacity to Multiple Segments ToFrom Trucking serves two segments of customers.\\nOne segment (A) is willing to pay $3.50 per cubic foot but wants to commit to a shipment with only 24 hours notice.\\nThe other segment (B) is willing to pay only $2.00 per cubic foot and is willing to commit to a shipment with up to one-week notice.\\nWith two weeks to go, demand for segment A is forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of 3,000 cubic feet and a standard deviation of 1,000.\\nHow much of the available capacity should be reserved for segment A?\\nHow should ToFrom change its decision if segment A is willing to pay $5 per cubic foot?\\nAnalysis: In this case we have Revenue from segment A, pA = $3.50 per cubic foot Revenue from segment B, pB = $2.00 per cubic foot Mean demand for segment A, DA = 3,000 cubic feet Standard deviation of demand for segment A, sA = 1,000 cubic feet .\\nCA = NORMINV(1 - pB>pA, DA, sA) = NORMINV(1 - 2.00>3.50, 3,000, 1,000) = 2,820 cubic feet Thus, ToFrom should reserve 2,820 cubic feet of truck capacity for segment A when customers from this segment are willing to pay $3.50 per cubic foot.\\nIf the amount customers are willing to pay increases from $3.50 to $5.00, the reserved capacity should be increased to CA = NORMINV(1 - pB>pA, DA, sA) = NORMINV(1 - 2.00>5.00, 3,000, 1,000) = 3,253 cubic feet Ideally, the demand forecast for all customer segments should be revised and a new reservation quantity calculated each time a customer order is processed.\\nIn practice, such a procedure would be difficult to implement.\\nIt is more practical to revise the forecast and the reservation quantity after a period of time over which either the forecast demand or the forecast accuracy has changed by a significant amount.\\nAnother approach to differential pricing is to create different versions of a product targeted at different segments.\\nPublishers introduce new books from best-selling authors as hardcover editions and charge a higher price.\\nThe same books are introduced later as paperback editions at a lower price.\\nThe two versions are used to charge a higher price to the segment that wants to read the book as soon as it is introduced.\\nDifferent versions can also be created by bundling different options and services with the same basic product.\\nAutomobile manufacturers create a high-end, a mid-level, and a low-end version of the most popular models based on the options provided.\\nThis policy allows them to charge differential prices to different segments for the same core product.\\nMany contact lens manufacturers sell the same lens with a one-week, one-month, and six-month warranty.\\nIn this instance, the same product with different services in the form of warranty is used to charge differential prices.\\nTo use revenue management successfully when serving multiple customer segments, a firm must use the following tactics effectively: ?Price based on the value assigned by each segment ?Use different prices for each segment ?Forecast at the segment level  .\\nFreight railroads and trucking firms have not used revenue management with multiple segments effectively.\\nAirlines, in contrast, have been much more effective in using this approach.\\nA major hindrance for railroads is the lack of scheduled freight trains.\\nWithout scheduled trains, it is hard to separate the higher-price and lower-price segments.\\nTo take advantage of revenue management opportunities, owners of transportation assets in the supply chain have to offer some scheduled services as a mechanism for separating the higher- and lower-price segments.\\nWithout scheduled services, it is difficult to separate customers that are willing to commit early from those that want to use the service at the last minute.\\nKey Point If a supplier serves multiple customer segments with a fixed asset, it can improve revenues by setting different prices for each segment.\\nPrices must be set with barriers such that the segment willing to pay more is not able to pay the lower price.\\nThe amount of the asset reserved for the higher-price segment is such that the expected marginal revenue from the higher-price segment equals the price to the lowerprice segment.\\nAny asset that loses value over time is perishable.\\nClearly, fruits, vegetables, and pharmaceuticals are perishable.\\nThis list also includes products such as computers and cell phones that lose value as new models are introduced.\\nHigh-fashion apparel is perishable because it cannot be sold at full price once the season is past.\\nPerishable assets also include all forms of production, transportation, and storage capacity that is wasted if not fully utilized.\\nUnused capacity from the past has no value.\\nThus, all unutilized capacity is equivalent to perished capacity.\\nA well-known example of revenue management in retailing of apparel was the original Filene\\'s Basement in Boston.\\nMerchandise was first sold at the main store at full price.\\nLeftover merchandise was moved to the basement and its price reduced incrementally over a 35-day period until it sold.\\nAny unsold merchandise was then given away to charity.\\nToday, most department stores progressively discount merchandise over the sales season and then sell any remaining inventory to an outlet store, which follows a similar pricing strategy.\\nAnother example of revenue management for a perishable asset is the use of overbooking by the airline industry.\\nAn airplane seat loses all value once the plane takes off.\\nGiven that people often do not show up for a plane even when they have a reservation, airlines sell more reservations than the capacity of the plane, to maximize expected revenue.\\nThe two revenue management tactics used for perishable assets are 1.\\nVary price dynamically over time to maximize expected revenue 2.\\nOverbook sales of the asset to account for cancellations Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing, the tactic of varying price over time, is suitable for assets such as fashion apparel that have a clear date beyond which they lose a lot of their value.\\nApparel designed for the winter does not have much value by April.\\nA retailer that has purchased 100 ski jackets in October has many options with regard to its pricing strategy.\\nIt can charge a high price initially.\\nThis strategy will result in fewer sales early in the season (though at a higher price), leaving more jackets to be sold later during the season, when they have lower value to customers.\\nAnother option is to charge a lower price initially, selling more jackets early in the season (though at a lower price) and leaving fewer jackets to be sold at a discount.\\nThis trade-off determines the profits for the retailer.\\nTo vary price effectively over time for a perishable asset, the asset owner must be able to estimate the value of the asset over time and forecast the impact of price on customer demand effectively.\\nEffective differential pricing over time generally increases the level of product availability for the consumer willing to pay full price and also increases total profits for the retailer.\\nWe now discuss a simple methodology for dynamic pricing when the seller has a specified quantity Q of a single product at the start of the season.\\nWe assume that the seller is able to divide the selling season into k periods and can forecast the demand curve for each period.\\nThe underlying assumptions here are that customers\\' response to pricing can be predicted over time and customers will not change their behavior in response to anticipated price changes.\\nFor simplicity, we assume that given a price pi in period i, the demand di in period i is given by  di = Ai - Bipi  This is a linear demand curve, but in general the demand curve need not be linear.\\nWe present the linear case here because it is easier to understand and solve.\\nThe retailer wants to vary the price over time to maximize the revenue it can extract from the Q units it has on hand at the beginning of the season.\\nThe dynamic pricing problem faced by the retailer can then be formulated as follows:  k Max a pi(Ai - Bipi) i=1  .\\nsubject to  k a (Ai - Bipi) ... Q i=1 Ai - Bipi ?0 for i = 1, ?, k  As formulated, the dynamic pricing problem is simple enough that it can be solved directly using Excel as illustrated in Example 16-3.\\nEXAMPLE 16-3 Dynamic Pricing  A retailer has purchased 400 ski parkas before the start of the winter season at a cost of $100 each.\\nThe season lasts three months, and the retailer has forecast demand in each of the three months to be d1 = 300 - p1, d2 = 300 - 1.3p2, and d3 = 300 - 1.8p3.\\nHow should the retailer vary the price of the parka over the three months to maximize revenue?\\nIf the retailer charges a constant price over the three months, what should it be?\\nHow much gain in revenue results from dynamic pricing?\\nsubject to  Maxp1(300 - p1) + p2(300 - 1.3p2) + p3(300 - 1.8p3)  (300 - p1) + (300 - 1.3p2) + (300 - 1.8p3) ... 400 300 - p1, 300 - 1.3p2, 300 - 1.8p3 ?0  This problem can be formulated using Solver in Excel as shown in Figure 16-4.\\nThe cells B5:B7 contain the price variables, cells C5:C7 contain the resulting demand from the respective demand curves, and cells D5:D7 contain the revenue in each period.\\nThe total demand across the three periods is in cell C8 and the total revenue is in cell D8.\\nThe quantity at the beginning of the season is in cell B3.\\nAs shown in Figure 16-4, the optimal strategy for the retailer is to price at $162.20 in the first month, $127.58 in the second month, and $95.53 in the third month.\\nThis gives total revenue of $51,697.94 for the retailer.\\nThe problem of obtaining the optimal fixed price over the three-month season can be formulated in Excel as shown in Figure 16-5.\\nAll cell formulas except B6 and B7 are as in Figure 16-4.\\nIf the retailer wants to have a fixed price over the three months, it should price the jackets at $121.95 for resulting revenue of $48,780.49.\\nWe can see that dynamic pricing allows the retailer to increase profits by almost $3,000, from $8,780 to $11,698.\\nOnce we have understood how to price the product dynamically over the season, we can go back and ask how many units the retailer should purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profits, as described in Example 16-4.\\nEXAMPLE 16-4 Evaluating Quantity with Dynamic Pricing Return to the retailer in Example 16-3.\\nHow many parkas should the retailer purchase at the beginning of the season, and how should they be priced over the three months of the season to maximize profits?\\nAnalysis: In this case, the quantity at the beginning of the season is also a decision variable.\\nThe retailer\\'s problem can now be formulated as follows: Max p1(300 - p1) + p2(300 - 1.3p2) + p3(300 - 1.8p3) - 100Q subject to (300 - p1) + (300 - 1.3p2) + (300 - 1.8p3) ... Q 300 - p1, 300 - 1.3p2, 300 - 1.8p3, Q ?0 The problem can be formulated in Excel as shown in Figure 16-6 to obtain the optimal initial quantity and dynamic prices over the season.\\nAll cell formulas except cell B3 and D9 are as in Figure 16-4.\\nIt is optimal for the retailer to order 245 jackets at the beginning of the season.\\nThey are then priced at $200 for the first month, $165.38 for the second month, and $133.33 for the third month.\\nThe total profit for the retailer with the optimal order quantity and dynamic pricing is $17,557.69.\\nIn reality, the dynamic pricing problem is more complicated because demand is unpredictable and customers behave strategically in that they may decide to delay their purchase if they know that prices will drop over time.\\nAn excellent discussion of models that can be used in this more complex setting can be found in Talluri and Van Ryzin (2004).\\nThe issue of unpredictable demand and strategic customers is illustrated effectively in decisions made by the high-end retailer Saks Fifth Avenue in November 2008.\\nIn 2007, luxury goods from brands such as Prada, Gucci, and Dolce & Gabbana had become especially important for high-end retailers such as Saks because they maintained strong sales into mid-2008 even though retailing overall was starting to drop by then.\\nAs a result, Saks placed its orders for the holiday season of 2008 hoping for strong sales of these brands.\\nBy November, however, a huge disconnect existed between inventories at Saks and customer demand.\\nAt Saks\\'s annual \"private sale nights\" in early November for top customers, the usual 40 percent discounts got no response.\\nBy mid-November, competitors such as Neiman Marcus had also dropped prices by 40 percent and some designers were offering 90 percent discounts on \"sample sales.\"\\nAs Thanksgiving approached, Saks decided to offer 70 percent discounts.\\nSuch a decision with luxury goods makes the best customers who paid full price feel duped.\\nNext time, they are more likely to wait for prices to drop or even shift to a competitor.\\nFrequent discounts over the selling season have the impact of affecting customer behavior, making it harder for the retailer to effectively manage these discounts.\\nAs a result, they should be used carefully, especially for high-value goods.\\nKey Point Dynamic pricing can be a powerful tool to increase profits if the customers\\' sensitivity to price changes in the course of the season.\\nThis is often the case for fashion products, for which customers are less price sensitive early in the season but become more price sensitive toward the end of the season.\\nDynamic pricing should, however, carefully consider strategic behavior by customers who may anticipate future price drops.\\nOverbooking  The tactic of overbooking or overselling of the available asset is suitable in any situation in which customers are able to cancel orders and the value of the asset drops significantly after a deadline.\\nExamples include airline seats, items designed specially for Christmas, and production capacity.\\nIn each case, a limited amount of the asset is available, customers are allowed to cancel orders, and the asset loses value beyond a certain date.\\nIf the cancellation or the return rate can be predicted accurately, the overbooking level is easy to determine.\\nIn practice, however, the cancellation or return rate is uncertain.\\nThe basic trade-off to consider during overbooking is between having wasted capacity (or inventory) because of excessive cancellations or having a shortage of capacity (or inventory) because of few cancellations, in which case an expensive backup needs to be arranged.\\nThe cost of wasted capacity is the margin that would have been generated if the capacity had been used for production.\\nThe cost of a capacity shortage is the loss per unit that results from having to go to a backup source.\\nThe goal when making the overbooking decision is to maximize supply chain profits by minimizing the cost of wasted capacity and the cost of capacity shortage.\\nWe now develop this trade-off in terms of a formula that can be used to set overbooking levels for an asset.\\nLet p be the price at which each unit of the asset is sold, and let c be the cost of using or producing each unit of the asset.\\nIn case of asset shortage, let b be the cost per unit at which a backup can be used.\\nThus, the marginal cost of having wasted capacity is Cw = p - c, and the marginal cost of having a capacity shortage is Cs = b - p. If the cost of backup capacity is less than the sale price, there is no reason to limit the overbooking.\\nThe interesting case arises when the cost of backup capacity exceeds the sale price.\\nThe trade-off to obtain the optimal overbooking level is similar to the trade-off described in Chapter 13 to obtain the optimal cycle service level for seasonal items given by Equation 13.1.\\nLet O* be the optimal overbooking level, and let s* be the probability that cancellations will be less than or equal to O*.\\nSimilar to the derivation of Equation 13.1, the optimal overbooking level is obtained as  s* = Prob (cancellations ... O*) =  Cw Cw + Cs  .\\nIf the distribution of cancellations is known in absolute terms to be normally distributed, with a mean of mc and a standard deviation of sc, the optimal overbooking level is evaluated as  O* = F-1(s*, mc, sc) = NORMINV(s*, mc, sc)  .\\nIf the cancellation distribution is known only as a function of the booking level (capacity L + overbooking O) to have a mean of m(L + O) and a standard deviation of s(L + O), the optimal overbooking level is obtained as a solution to the following equation:  O = F-1(s*, m(L + O), s(L + O)) = NORMINV(s*, m(L + O), s(L + O)) (16.8)  Observe that the optimal level of overbooking should increase as the margin per unit increases, and the level of overbooking should decrease as the cost of replacement capacity goes up.\\nAlso observe that the use of overbooking increases asset utilization by customers.\\noverbooking decreases the number of customers that are turned away and thus improves asset availability to the customer, while improving profits for the asset owner.\\nThe evaluation of overbooking is illustrated in Example 16-5.\\nEXAMPLE 16-5 Overbooking  Consider an apparel supplier that is taking orders for dresses with a Christmas motif.\\nThe production capacity available from the supplier is 5,000 dresses, and it makes $10 for each dress sold.\\nThe supplier is currently taking orders from retailers and must decide on how many orders to commit to at this time.\\nIf it has orders that exceed capacity, it has to arrange for backup capacity that results in a loss of $5 per dress.\\nRetailers have been known to cancel their orders near the winter season as they have better visibility into expected demand.\\nHow many orders should the supplier accept if cancellations are normally distributed, with a mean of 800 and a standard deviation of 400?\\nHow many orders should the supplier accept if cancellations are normally distributed, with a mean of 15 percent of the orders accepted and a coefficient of variation of 0.5?\\nAnalysis: The supplier has the following parameters:  .\\ns* =  Cw Cw + Cs  =  10 10 + 5  = 0.667  .\\nO* = NORMINV(s*, mc, sc) = NORMINV(0.667, 800, 400) = 973 In this case, the supplier should overbook by 973 dresses and take orders for a total of 5,973 dresses.\\nIf cancellations are normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the booking level and a coefficient of variation of 0.5, the optimal overbooking level is obtained using Equation 16.8 to be the solution of the following equation: O = NORMINV(0.667, 0.15(5000 + O), 0.075(5000 + O)) This equation can be solved using the Excel tool Solver to obtain the optimal overbooking level: O* = 1,115 In this case, the supplier should overbook by 1,115 dresses and take an order for up to 6,115 dresses.\\nOverbooking as a tactic has been used in the airline, passenger rail, and hotel industries.\\nIt has not, however, been used to the extent it should be in many supply chain scenarios including production, warehousing, and transportation capacity.\\nThere is no reason that a third-party warehouse that rents to multiple customers should not sell total space that exceeds the available space.\\nA backup will clearly be needed if all customers use warehouse space to capacity.\\nIn all other cases, the available warehouse capacity will cover the need for space.\\nOverbooking in this case will improve revenues for the warehouse while allowing more customers to use the available warehouse space.\\nKey Point Overbooking or overselling of a supply chain asset is a valuable tactic if order cancellations occur and the asset is perishable.\\nThe level of overbooking is based on the trade-off between the cost of wasting the asset if too many cancellations lead to unused assets and the cost of arranging a backup if too few cancellations lead to committed orders being larger than the available capacity.\\nSeasonal peaks of demand are a common occurrence in many supply chains.\\nMost retailers in the United States achieve a significant fraction of their annual sales during the month of December.\\nOne such example is Amazon.\\nAs a result of the seasonal peak, the requirement for picking and packing and transportation capacity at Amazon significantly increases.\\nBringing in short-term capacity is expensive and decreases Amazon\\'s margins.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 9, off-peak discounting is an effective method of shifting demand from the peak to the off-peak period.\\nAmazon typically offers free shipping for orders that are placed in November.\\nThe price discount encourages some customers to shift their demand from December to November, thereby reducing the December peak for Amazon and allowing it to extract a higher profit.\\nSimultaneously, this strategy offers a price break to customers who are willing to order early.\\nFaced with seasonal peaks, an effective revenue management tactic is to charge a higher price during the peak period and a lower price during off-peak periods.\\nThe result is a demand shift from peak to off-peak periods.\\nSuch an outcome is beneficial if the discount given during the off-peak period is more than offset by the decrease in cost because of a smaller peak and the increase in revenue during the off-peak period.\\nSee Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of the trade-offs involved when a firm uses pricing to deal with seasonal peaks.\\nThe hotel industry uses differential pricing by day of week and time of year.\\nHere the goal is not to shift demand but to increase demand during periods of low demand by attracting pricesensitive customers, such as vacationing families, with a price discount.\\nThe Marriott Corporation has been quite successful in this effort.\\nDemand for hotel rooms is known to vary by day of the week.\\nFor Marriott, which targets business customers, peak demand days occur in the middle of the week.\\nMarriott offers lower rates during the weekend to encourage families to use the hotel during that time.\\nAnother revenue management tactic that Marriott uses is to charge customers a lower rate if they stay over a longer period that also covers low-demand days.\\nAn interesting example of peak pricing is the Next restaurant started by star chef Grant Achatz in Chicago in 2010.\\nThe restaurant sells advance tickets for seatings at different times.\\nTicket prices vary based on the menu but also on the time a customer signs up for.\\nThus, a Saturday night seating at 8 P.M. is more expensive than a Tuesday night seating at 9.30 P.M.\\nSimilarly, many sports teams charge more for games involving popular opponents and less for weaker opponents and less popular times.\\nOff-peak discounting can be an effective revenue management tactic for owners of production or transportation capacity in any supply chain facing seasonal peak demand, because changing capacity over time is expensive.\\nThis tactic increases profits for the owner of assets, decreases the price paid by a fraction of customers, and also brings in potentially new customers during the off-peak discount period.\\nMost firms face a market in which some customers purchase in bulk at a discount and others buy single units or small lots at a higher price.\\nConsider an owner of warehousing capacity in a supply chain.\\nWarehousing capacity may be leased in bulk to a large company or in small amounts to  .\\nlarge companies for their emergency needs or to small companies.\\nThe large company leasing space in bulk typically gets a discount compared to the others.\\nThe owner of warehousing space thus faces the following trade-off: It could lease the space to the bulk buyer at a discount or save some of the space for higher price demand for small amounts of warehouse space that may or may not arise.\\nA similar decision needs to be made by each purchaser of production, warehousing, and transportation assets in a supply chain.\\nConsider a company looking for shipping capacity for global operations.\\nOne option is for it to sign a long-term bulk contract with a shipping firm.\\nAnother option is to purchase shipping capacity on the spot market.\\nThe long-term bulk contract has the advantage of a fixed, low price but has the disadvantage of being wasted if it is not utilized.\\nThe spot market has the disadvantage of a higher average price but has the advantage of never being wasted.\\nThe purchaser must consider this trade-off when deciding the amount of long-term bulk shipping contracts to sign.\\nGiven that both the spot market price and the purchaser\\'s need for the asset are uncertain, a decision tree approach as discussed in Chapter 6 should be used to evaluate the amount of longterm bulk contract to sign.\\nFor the simple case in which the spot market price is known but demand is uncertain, the extent of the bulk contract can be evaluated using a formula.\\nLet cB be the bulk rate, and let cS be the spot market price for the asset.\\nLet Q* be the optimal amount of the asset to be purchased in bulk and let p* be the probability that demand for the asset does not exceed Q*.\\nThe marginal cost of purchasing another unit in bulk is cB.\\nThe expected marginal cost of not purchasing another unit in bulk and then purchasing it in the spot market is (1 - p*)cS.\\nIf the optimal amount of the asset is purchased in bulk, the marginal cost of the bulk purchase should equal the expected marginal cost of the spot market purchase; that is, cB = (1 - p*)cS.\\nThus, the optimal value p* is obtained as  p* = cS - cB cS  (16.9)  If demand is normally distributed, with a mean of m and a standard deviation of s the optimal amount, Q*, of the asset purchased in bulk is obtained as  Q* = F-1(p*, m, s) = NORMINV(p*, m, s)  .\\nObserve that the amount of bulk purchase increases if either the spot market price increases or the bulk price decreases.\\nEvaluation of bulk contract purchases is illustrated in Example 16-6.  .\\nEXAMPLE 16-6 Long-Term Bulk Contracts versus the Spot Market A manufacturer sources several components from China and has monthly transportation needs that are normally distributed, with a mean of m = 10 million units and a standard deviation of s = 4 million units.\\nThe manufacturer must decide on the portfolio of transportation contracts to carry.\\nA long-term bulk contract costs $10,000 per month for a million units.\\nTransportation capacity is also available in the spot market at an average price of $12,500 per million units.\\nFor how much transportation capacity should the manufacturer sign a long-term bulk contract?\\nAnalysis: In this case we have Bulk contract cost, cB = $10,000 per million units Spot market cost, cS = $12,500 per million units Using Equation 16.9, we obtain p* = cS - cB = 12,500 - 10,000 = 0.2 cS 12,500 .\\nQ* = NORMINV(p*, m, s) = NORMINV(0.2, 10, 4) = 6.63 Thus, the manufacturer should sign a long-term bulk contract for 6.63 million units per month and purchase any transportation capacity beyond that on the spot market.\\nKey Point Most consumers of production, warehousing, and transportation assets in a supply chain face the problem of constructing a portfolio of long-term bulk contracts and spot market contracts.\\nThe basic decision is the size of the bulk contract.\\nThe fundamental trade-off is between wasting a portion of a low-cost bulk contract and paying more for the asset on the spot market.\\nEvaluate your market carefully.\\nThe first step in revenue management is to identify the customer segments being served and their needs.\\nThe goal is to understand what the customer is buying, as opposed to what you are selling.\\nIf an airline thinks of itself as only selling seats, it cannot use revenue management.\\nIt has to think of itself as selling seats, the ability to book at the last minute, the ability to alter flight plans, and the ability to pick a convenient flight schedule.\\nOnly then do revenue management opportunities present themselves.\\nHaving identified the market needs, it is crucial to gather accurate and complete data relating to products offered; prices; competition; and, most important, customer behavior.\\nInformation about customer behavior is a valuable asset that helps identify consumer preferences.\\nUltimately, a proper understanding of customer preferences and a quantification of the impact of various tactics on consumer behavior are at the core of successful revenue management.\\nQuantify the benefits of revenue management.\\nIt is critical to quantify the expected benefits from revenue management before starting the project.\\nIdeally, historical data and a good model of customer preferences should be used to estimate the benefits  .\\nthrough a simulation.\\nThe outcome of this step should be explicit revenue targets that are to be achieved as a result of revenue management.\\nThe revenue targets should be such that all people involved believe in them.\\nThe revenue management effort should then be compared to the expected benefit.\\nImplement a forecasting process.\\nThe foundation of any revenue management system is the forecasting function.\\nTo use overbooking with any degree of success, an airline must be able to forecast cancellation patterns.\\nBy forecasting, we do not mean obtaining an estimate that is always accurate.\\nForecasting involves estimating demand and also attributing an expected error to the forecast itself.\\nBoth the estimated value and the expected error are important inputs into any revenue management model.\\nIt is generally difficult to forecast at a micro level, where all behavior is essentially idiosyncratic.\\nFor example, an airline with 100 fare classes will find it difficult to forecast demand for each class and also forecast the behavior of customers when they find a fare class full.\\nIt is thus important to ensure that revenue management tactics are planned over a level that is aggregated enough so that effective forecasting is possible.\\nFinally, as new information becomes available, reforecast to see if the revenue management tactics currently in place are still appropriate.\\nThe frequency of forecasting will depend on the amount of market activity.\\nIdeally, the forecast and the revenue management decision should be evaluated after every transaction.\\nMost of the benefits of revenue management are realized through a few dimensions for differential pricing.\\nAdditional complexity adds to the effort required without necessarily adding much value.\\nAn airline, for example, can achieve most of the benefits from revenue management using a few fare classes.\\nFurther complexity will only make forecasting more difficult without necessarily enhancing revenue.\\nInvolve both sales and operations.\\nSalespeople must understand the revenue management tactic in place so they can align their sales pitch accordingly.\\nIt makes no sense for a firm to offer an off-peak discount if the sales force continues to push people toward the period with highest prices.\\nThe sales force must differentiate between those customers that truly need the supply chain asset during the peak period and those that will benefit from moving their order to the off-peak period.\\nSuch an approach will increase profits for the firm while also satisfying customers.\\nOperations must understand the potential outcomes of the revenue management tactics in place and be informed of actual outcomes taking place.\\nFor example, operations in an airline using overbooking must be ready to book passengers who are unable to depart on the full flight onto other feasible flights.\\nUnderstand and inform the customer.\\nCustomers will have a negative perception of revenue management tactics if they are simply presented as a mechanism for extracting maximum revenue.\\nSuch a perception is likely to diminish customer loyalty in the long term and encourage the customer to try and game the process.\\nThus, it is important for the firm to structure its revenue management program in a way that revenue increases while improving service along some dimension that is important to customers that pay the highest price.\\nAs discussed earlier in the chapter, a proper implementation of revenue management tactics should achieve both outcomes.\\nIt is important for the firm to convey this information to its most valuable customers.\\nRemember, a change in behavior by this set of customers can destroy any potential benefit of a revenue management program!\\nIntegrate supply planning with revenue management.\\nAlthough the supply planning and revenue management ideas we discuss in this book are valuable in their own right, combining them can create significantly more value.\\nThe point here is not to use revenue management in isolation, but rather to combine it with decisions on the supply side.\\nFor instance, if, after applying revenue management, a manufacturer finds that the production of a short lead time facility provides the majority of its profit, it should look into adding more short lead time capacity.\\nUnderstanding and acting on the interactions among supply, demand, and pricing can bring about powerful results.\\nUnderstand the role of revenue management in a supply chain.\\nRevenue management uses differential pricing to better match supply and demand and increase supply chain profits.\\nTraditionally, firms have changed the availability of assets to match supply and demand.\\nRevenue management aims to reduce any supply/demand imbalance by using pricing as a lever.\\nA big advantage of using revenue management is that a change in pricing is much easier to reverse compared to an investment in supply chain assets.\\nWhen it is used properly, revenue management increases firm profits while leaving valuable customers more satisfied through greater asset availability.\\nIdentify conditions under which revenue management tactics can be effective.\\nRevenue management tactics can be effective if the firm serves multiple segments, each placing a different value on the supply chain asset, or the asset is perishable and loses value over time, or demand for the asset has distinct seasonal peaks, or the asset can be bought and sold both using long-term bulk contracts and on the spot market.\\nDescribe trade-offs that must be considered when making revenue management decisions.\\nWhen serving multiple customer segments, the basic revenue management decision is the amount of the asset to save for the higher-price segment.\\nThe trade-off is between saving too much and spoiling the asset if the higher-price demand does not materialize and turning away higher-price customers because too little of the asset was saved.\\nWhen the asset is perishable, the basic revenue management decisions are about how to change the asset price over time and the degree to which the asset should be overbooked or oversold.\\nWhen changing the asset price over time, the trade-off is between charging a higher price initially and having too much inventory left over to discount later on, and charging a low initial price and having little inventory left over.\\nWhen overbooking, the trade-off is between not overbooking enough and wasting the available asset and overbooking too much and having to arrange for backup capacity at high cost.\\nWhen demand has distinct seasonal peaks, the basic revenue management decision is the timing and extent of the off-peak discount.\\nThe trade-off is between the additional cost of serving the seasonal peak, and the impact on demand and thus revenue from offering an off-peak discount.\\nFor a seller using both longterm bulk contracts and the spot market, the basic revenue management decision is the fraction of the asset to save for the spot market.\\nThe basic trade-off is between getting a committed demand at a lower price with the bulk contract and potentially getting a high price on the spot market.\\nFor a buyer, the basic decision is the fraction of anticipated demand to purchase from a long-term bulk contract.\\nThe basic trade-off is between getting a long-term bulk contract at a low price that may not be fully used and purchasing only the amount required from the spot market but at a higher price.\\n Understand the importance of information and information technology in a supply chain.\\nKnow at a high level how each supply chain driver uses information.\\nUnderstand the major applications of supply chain information technology and the processes that they enable.\\nInformation is crucial to the performance of a supply chain because it provides the basis on which supply chain managers make decisions.\\nInformation technology consists of the tools used to gain awareness of information, analyze this information, and execute on it to improve the performance of the supply chain.\\nIn this chapter, we explore the importance of information, its uses, and the technologies that enable supply chain managers to use information to make better decisions.\\nIT consists of the hardware, software, and people throughout a supply chain that gather, analyze, and execute upon information.\\nIT serves as the eyes and ears (and sometimes a portion of the brain) of management in a supply chain, capturing and analyzing the information necessary to make a good decision.\\nFor instance, an IT system at a PC manufacturer may show the finished goods inventory at different stages of the supply chain and also provide the optimal production plan and level of inventory based on demand and supply information.\\nUsing IT systems to capture and analyze information can have a significant impact on a firm\\'s performance.\\nFor example, a major manufacturer of computer workstations and servers found that most of its information on 488  .\\ncustomer demand was not being used to set production schedules and inventory levels.\\nThe manufacturing group lacked this demand information, which essentially forced it to make inventory and production decisions blindly.\\nBy installing a supply chain software system, the company was able to gather and analyze demand data to produce recommended stocking levels.\\nUsing the IT system enabled the company to cut its inventory in half, because managers could now make decisions based on customer demand information rather than manufacturing\\'s educated guesses.\\nLarge impacts like this underscore the importance of IT as a driver of supply chain performance.\\nAvailability and analysis of information to drive decision making is a key to the success of a supply chain.\\nCompanies that have built their success on the availability and analysis of information include Seven-Eleven Japan, Walmart, Amazon, UPS, and Netflix.\\nTo support effective supply chain decisions, information must have the following characteristics: 1.\\nInformation must be accurate.\\nWithout information that gives a true picture of the state of the supply chain, it is difficult to make good decisions.\\nThat is not to say that all information must be 100 percent correct, but rather that the data available paint a picture that is at least directionally correct.\\nInformation must be accessible in a timely manner.\\nAccurate information often exists, but by the time it is available, it is either out of date or it is not in an accessible form.\\nTo make good decisions, a manager needs to have up-to-date information that is easily accessible.\\nInformation must be of the right kind.\\nDecision makers need information that they can use.\\nOften companies have large amounts of data that are not helpful in making a decision.\\nCompanies must think about what information should be recorded so that valuable resources are not wasted collecting meaningless data while important data go unrecorded.\\nInformation must be shared.\\nA supply chain can be effective only if all its stakeholders share a common view of the information that they use to make business decisions.\\nDifferent information with different stakeholders results in misaligned action plans that hurt supply chain performance.\\nInformation is used when making a wide variety of decisions about each supply chain driver, as discussed next.\\nDetermining the location, capacity, and schedules of a facility requires information on the trade-offs among efficiency and flexibility, demand, exchange rates, taxes, and so on (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6).\\nWalmart\\'s suppliers use the demand information from Walmart\\'s stores to set their production schedules.\\nWalmart uses demand information to determine where to place its new stores and cross-docking facilities.\\nSetting optimal inventory policies requires information that includes demand patterns, cost of carrying inventory, costs of stocking out, and costs of ordering (see Chapters 11, 12, and 13).\\nFor example, Walmart collects detailed demand, cost, margin, and supplier information to make these inventory policy decisions.\\nDeciding on transportation networks, routings, modes, shipments, and vendors requires information about costs, customer locations, and shipment sizes to make good decisions (see Chapter 14).\\nWalmart uses information to tightly integrate its operations with those of its suppliers.\\nThis integration allows Walmart to implement cross-docking in its transportation network, saving on both inventory and transportation costs.\\nInformation on product margins, prices, quality, delivery lead times, and so on, are all important in making sourcing decisions.\\nGiven sourcing deals with inter-enterprise transactions, a wide range of transactional information must be recorded in order to execute operations, even once sourcing decisions have been made.\\nPricing and revenue management.\\nTo set pricing policies, one needs information on demand, both its volume and various customer segments\\' willingness to pay, and on  .\\nmany supply issues, such as the product margin, lead time, and availability.\\nUsing this information, firms can make intelligent pricing decisions to improve their supply chain profitability.\\nIn summary, information is crucial to making good supply chain decisions at all three levels of decision making (strategy, planning, and operations) and in each of the other supply chain drivers (facilities, inventory, transportation, sourcing, and pricing).\\nIT enables not only the gathering of these data to create supply chain visibility, but also the analysis of these data so that the supply chain decisions made will maximize profitability.\\nWe develop a framework that managers can use to understand the role of IT within the supply chain.\\nAt its core, IT provides access and reporting of supply chain transaction data.\\nMore advanced IT systems then layer on a level of analytics that uses transaction data to proactively improve supply chain performance.\\nFor example, as a baseline, good IT systems will record and report demand, inventory, and fulfillment information for Amazon.\\nIT systems that provide analytics then allow Amazon to decide whether to open new distribution centers and how to stock them.\\nGiven that both reporting and analysis require the availability of accurate transaction data, enterprise software forms the foundation of a supply chain IT system.\\nThis is a space that has matured from the early 1990s to the early 2000s with SAP and Oracle as the two major players.\\nDuring this period, enterprise software providers such as SAP and Oracle worked to extend their analytics capabilities while best of breed analytics providers such as i2 and Manugistics attempted to provide transaction level capability.\\nThe winners were the enterprise software providers, and the first decade of the 21st century saw significant consolidation across the industry.\\nWe propose that further evolution of supply chain IT can be viewed in the context of the supply chain macro processes discussed in Chapter 1.\\nThe Supply Chain Macro Processes The emergence of supply chain management has broadened the scope across which companies make decisions.\\nThis scope has expanded from trying to optimize performance across the division, to the enterprise, and now to the entire supply chain.\\nThis broadening of scope emphasizes the importance of including processes all along the supply chain when making decisions.\\nFrom an enterprise\\'s perspective, all processes within its supply chain can be categorized into three main areas: processes focused downstream, processes focused internally, and processes focused upstream.\\nWe use this classification to define the three macro supply chain processes (see Chapter 1) as follows: ?Customer relationship management (CRM).\\nProcesses that focus on downstream interactions between the enterprise and its customers.\\n?Internal supply chain management (ISCM).\\nProcesses that focus on internal operations within the enterprise.\\nNote that the software industry commonly calls this \"supply chain management\" (without the word \"internal\"), even though the focus is entirely within the enterprise.\\nIn our definition, supply chain management includes all three macro processes, CRM, ISCM, and SRM.\\n?Supplier relationship management (SRM).\\nProcesses that focus on upstream interactions between the enterprise and its suppliers.\\nAll operation and analytics related to the macro processes rest on the transaction management foundation (TMF), which includes basic enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (and its components, such as financials and human resources), infrastructure software, and integration software.\\nTMF software is necessary for the three macro processes to function and to communicate with one another.\\nThe relationship between the three macro processes and the transaction management foundation can be seen in Figure 17-1.\\nSupplier Relationship Management (SRM)  Internal Supply Chain Management (ISCM)  .\\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)  Transaction Management Foundation (TMF) .\\nWhy Focus on the Macro Processes?\\nAs the performance of an enterprise becomes more closely linked to the performance of its supply chain, it is crucial that firms focus on these macro processes.\\nAs we have emphasized in this book, good supply chain management is not a zero-sum game in which one stage of the supply chain increases profits at the expense of another.\\nGood supply chain management instead attempts to grow the supply chain surplus, which requires each firm to expand the scope beyond internal processes and look at the entire supply chain in terms of the three macro processes to achieve breakthrough performance.\\nA good supply chain coordinates all the macro processes across all stages.\\nApple is an example of a company that has coordinated all macro processes to introduce and sell blockbuster products such as the iPad2.\\nApple has been very successful in its interactions with customers both in designing products that meet their needs but also in operating Apple retail as a successful and profitable endeavor.\\nAll its products are designed in-house but manufactured by a third party.\\nDespite this, Apple managed the release of the iPad2 to effectively meet huge demand.\\nStrong coordination across all the macro processes has been fundamental for the level of success achieved by Apple.\\nWe now discuss each of the macro processes and the role played by IT.\\nThe CRM macro process consists of processes that take place between an enterprise and its customers downstream in the supply chain.\\nThe goal of the CRM macro process is to generate customer demand and facilitate transmission and tracking of orders.\\nWeakness in this process results in demand being lost and a poor customer experience because orders are not processed and executed effectively.\\nThe key processes under CRM are as follows: ?Marketing.\\nMarketing processes involve decisions regarding which customers to target, how to target customers, what products to offer, how to price products, and how to manage the actual campaigns that target customers.\\nGood IT systems in the marketing area within CRM provide analytics that improve the marketing decisions on pricing, product profitability, and customer profitability, among other functions.\\nThe sell process focuses on making an actual sale to a customer (compared to marketing, in which processes are more focused on planning whom to sell to and what to sell).\\nThe sell process includes providing the sales force with the information it needs to make a sale and then to execute the actual sale.\\nExecuting the sale may require the salesperson (or the customer) to build and configure orders by choosing among a variety of options and features.\\nThe sell process also requires such functionality as the ability to quote due dates and access information related to a customer order.\\nGood IT systems support sales force automation, configuration, and personalization to improve the sell process.\\nThe process of managing customer orders as they flow through an enterprise is important for the customer to track his order and for the enterprise to plan and execute order fulfillment.\\nThis process ties together demand from the customer with supply from the enterprise.\\nGood IT systems enable visibility of orders across the various stages that an order flows through before reaching the customer.\\n?Call/service center.\\nA call/service center is often the primary point of contact between a company and its customers.\\nA call/service center helps customers place orders, suggests products, solves problems, and provides information on order status.\\nGood IT systems have helped improve call/service center operations by facilitating and reducing work done by customer service representatives and by routing customers to representatives who are best suited to service their request.\\nAmazon has done an excellent job of using IT to enhance its CRM process.\\nThe company customizes the products presented to suit the individual customer (based on an analysis of customer preferences from past history and current clicks).\\nQuick ordering is facilitated by systems that allow one-click orders.\\nThe order is then visible to the customer until it is delivered.\\nIn the rare instances when a customer uses the call center, systems are in place to support a positive experience including offering a callback in case the call center is heavily loaded.\\nThe five largest CRM software providers in 2008 (as reported by Gartner) were SAP (22.5 percent), Oracle (16.1 percent), Salesforce.com (10.6 percent), Microsoft (6.4 percent), and Amdocs (4.9 percent).\\nISCM, as we discussed earlier, is focused on operations internal to the enterprise.\\nISCM includes all processes involved in planning for and fulfilling a customer order.\\nThe various processes included in ISCM are as follows: ?Strategic planning.\\nThis process focuses on the network design of the supply chain.\\nKey decisions include location and capacity planning of facilities.\\nFor more details on strategic planning decisions see Chapters 5 and 6.\\nDemand planning consists of forecasting demand and analyzing the impact on demand of demand management tools such as pricing and promotions.\\nFor more discussion of this process, see Chapter 7 on demand forecasting as well as Chapters 9 and 15 on pricing.\\nThe supply planning process takes as an input the demand forecasts produced by demand planning and the resources made available by strategic planning; then it produces an optimal plan to meet this demand.\\nFactory planning and inventory planning capabilities are typically provided by supply planning software.\\nFor more discussion of this process, see Chapters 8 and 9 on sales and operations planning and Chapters 11 and 12 on inventory management.\\nOnce a plan is in place to supply the demand, it must be executed.\\nThe fulfillment process links each order to a specific supply source and means of transportation.\\nThe software applications that typically fall into the fulfillment segment are transportation and warehousing management applications.\\nFor more discussion of this process, see Chapter 14 on transportation.\\nFinally, after the product has been delivered to the customer, it eventually must be serviced.\\nService processes focus on setting inventory levels for spare parts as well as scheduling service calls.\\nSome of the scheduling issues here are handled in a similar manner to aggregate planning, and the inventory issues are the typical inventory management problems.\\nGiven that the ISCM macro process aims to fulfill demand that is generated by CRM processes, strong integration is needed between the ISCM and CRM macro processes.\\nforecasting demand, interaction with CRM is essential, as the CRM applications are touching the customer and have the most data and insight on customer behavior.\\nSimilarly, the ISCM processes should have strong integration with the SRM macro process.\\nSupply planning, fulfillment, and field service are all dependent on suppliers and therefore the SRM processes.\\nIt is of little use for your factory to have the production capacity to meet demand if your supplier cannot supply the parts to make your product.\\nOrder management, which we discussed under CRM, must integrate closely with fulfillment and be an input for effective demand planning.\\nAgain, extended supply chain management requires that we integrate across the macro processes.\\nSuccessful ISCM software providers have helped improve decision making within ISCM processes.\\nGood integration with CRM and SRM, however, is still largely inadequate at both the organizational and software levels.\\nFuture opportunities are likely to arise partly in improving each ISCM process, but even more so in improving integration with CRM and SRM.\\nThe top five ISCM vendors in 2007 (as reported by Gartner) were SAP, Oracle, JDA, Ariba, and Manhattan Associates.\\nSAP (22.4 percent) and Oracle (16 percent) had a significantly larger market share than the other three (9.2 percent combined).\\nSRM includes those processes focused on the interaction between the enterprise and suppliers that are upstream in the supply chain.\\nThere is a natural fit between SRM processes and the ISCM processes, as integrating supplier constraints is crucial when creating internal plans.\\nThe major SRM processes are as follows: ?Design collaboration.\\nThis software aims to improve the design of products through collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers.\\nThe software facilitates the joint selection (with suppliers) of components that have positive supply chain characteristics such as ease of manufacturability or commonality across several end products.\\nOther design collaboration activities include the sharing of engineering change orders between a manufacturer and its suppliers.\\nThis eliminates the costly delays that occur when several suppliers are designing components for the manufacturer\\'s product concurrently.\\nSourcing software assists in the qualification of suppliers and helps in supplier selection, contract management, and supplier evaluation.\\nAn important objective is to analyze the amount that an enterprise spends with each supplier, often revealing valuable trends or areas for improvement.\\nSuppliers are evaluated along several key criteria, including lead time, reliability, quality, and price.\\nThis evaluation helps improve supplier performance and aids in supplier selection.\\nContract management is also an important part of sourcing, as many supplier contracts have complex details that must be tracked (such as volume-related price reductions).\\nSuccessful software in this area helps analyze supplier performance and manage contracts.\\nNegotiations with suppliers involve many steps, starting with a request for quote (RFQ).\\nThe negotiation process may also include the design and execution of auctions.\\nThe goal of this process is to negotiate an effective contract that specifies price and delivery parameters for a supplier in a way that best matches the enterprise\\'s needs.\\nSuccessful software automates the RFQ process and the execution of auctions.\\n\"Buy\" software executes the actual procurement of material from suppliers.\\nThis includes the creation, management, and approval of purchase orders.\\nSuccessful software in this area automates the procurement process and helps decrease processing cost and time.\\n?Supply collaboration.\\nOnce an agreement for supply is established between the enterprise and a supplier, supply chain performance can be improved by collaborating on forecasts, production plans, and inventory levels.\\nThe goal of collaboration is to ensure a common plan across the supply chain.\\nGood software in this area should be able to facilitate collaborative forecasting and planning in a supply chain.\\nSRM  ISCM  CRM  Design Collaboration Source Negotiate Buy Supply Collaboration  Strategic Planning Demand Planning Supply Planning Fulfillment Field Service  Market Sell Call Center Order Management  TMF  .\\nSignificant improvement in supply chain performance can be achieved if SRM processes are well integrated with appropriate CRM and ISCM processes.\\nFor instance, when designing a product, incorporating input from customers is a natural way to improve the design.\\nThis requires inputs from processes within CRM.\\nSourcing, negotiating, buying, and collaborating tie primarily into ISCM, as the supplier inputs are needed to produce and execute an optimal plan.\\nHowever, even these segments need to interface with CRM processes such as order management.\\nAgain, the theme of integrating the three macro processes is crucial for improved supply chain performance.\\nThe SRM space is highly fragmented in terms of software providers and not as well defined as CRM and ISCM.\\nAmong the larger players, SAP and Oracle have SRM functionality in their software.\\nThere are many niche players, however, who focus on different aspects of SRM.\\nAll three macro processes and their processes can be seen in Figure 17-2. .\\nThe transaction management foundation is the historical home of the largest enterprise software players.\\nIn the early 1990s, when much of the thinking in supply chain management was just getting off the ground and ERP systems were rapidly gaining popularity, there was little focus on the three macro processes we discussed earlier.\\nIn fact, there was little emphasis on software applications focused on improving decisions through analysis.\\nInstead, the focus at that time was on building transaction management and process automation systems that proved to be the foundation for future decision support applications.\\nThese systems excelled at the automation of simple transactions and processes and the creation of an integrated way to store and view data across the division (and sometimes the enterprise).\\nThe huge demand for these systems during the 1990s drove the ERP players to become the largest enterprise software companies.\\nAccording to Gartner, the top five ERP software vendors in 2010 were SAP, Oracle, Sage Group, Infor Global Solutions, and Microsoft.\\nThe real value of the transaction management foundation can be extracted only if decision making within the supply chain is improved.\\nThus, most recent growth in enterprise software has come from companies focused on improving decision making in the three macro processes.\\nThis has set the stage for what we are seeing today and will continue to see in the future--the realignment of the ERP companies into CRM, ISCM, and SRM companies.\\nCOORDINATION  Supply chain visibility, coordinated planning, forecasting, and replenishment, collaborative product development, coordinated logistics, coordinated promotions ...\\nSILOS  SRM  ISCM  CRM  Supplier  Our Company  Customer  .\\nAlready, the majority of ERP players\\' revenue comes from applications in the three macro processes.\\nA major advantage that ERP players have relative to best-of-breed providers is the inherent ability to integrate across the three macro process, often through the transaction management foundation.\\nERP players that focus on integrating across the macro processes along with developing good functionality in one or more macro process will continue to occupy a position of strength.\\nThe goal of a successful IT system is ultimately to help coordinate decisions and actions across the supply chain.\\nThis can happen only if IT supports the macro processes to coordinate and run as one rather than as disparate silos, as shown in Figure 17-3.  .\\nAt the highest level, we believe that the three SCM macro processes will continue to drive the evolution of supply chain IT.\\nWhile there is still plenty of room to improve the visibility and reporting of supply chain information, the relative focus on improved analysis to support decision making will continue to grow.\\nThe following three important trends will impact IT in the supply chain: 1.\\nThe growth in software as a service (SaaS) 2.\\nIncreased availability of real-time data 3.\\nIncreased use of mobile technology SaaS is defined as software that is owned, delivered, and managed remotely.\\nSalesforce.com is one of the best-known pure SaaS supply chain software providers (in CRM).\\nGartner has predicted that SaaS (which comprised about 10 percent of the enterprise software market in 2009) will grow to about 16 percent of global software sales by 2014.\\nThis shift is likely to occur because SaaS provides lower startup and maintenance costs compared to applications that are deployed onsite.\\nThese factors are particularly important for small and midsized companies.\\nTraditional enterprise software vendors such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft are increasing the availability of their software using the SaaS model.\\nThe availability of real-time information has exploded in most supply chains.\\nWhereas current supply chain software is primarily focused on improving strategy and planning decisions (often at the corporate level) that are revisited infrequently, significant opportunity exists to devise software that will use real-time information to help frontline supply chain staff (such as in transportation and warehousing) make smarter and faster decisions that are revisited frequently.\\nThe opportunity is to design systems that enable rapid insight based on real-time data.\\nThe increased use of mobile technology coupled with real-time information offers some supply chains an opportunity to better match demand to supply using differential pricing.\\nexample is an initiative by Groupon titled Groupon Now, which offers mobile users deals that are time and location specific.\\nBusinesses can improve profitability by offering deals when business is slow at specific locations.\\nConsumers benefit from getting a deal when and where they want it.\\nSuch an approach is likely to be applicable in many supply chain settings.\\nSeveral risks are associated with the use of IT in the supply chain, and the process of adding new supply chain capabilities with IT can be fraught with danger.\\nThe larger the change in the IT system, the greater is the risk of a negative impact on operations.\\nThe more ingrained IT becomes in companies, the greater is the risk that the firm will not be able to function properly if IT suffers a major failure.\\nHere we discuss some of the major risks posed by using IT in the supply chain and some ideas for mitigating these risks.\\nThe major areas of risk in IT can be divided into two broad categories.\\nThe first, and potentially the greater, is the risk involved with installing new IT systems.\\nDuring the process of getting new IT systems running, a firm is forced to transition from the old processes it used in its operations to the new processes in its IT system.\\nHere trouble can be found in both business processes and in technical issues.\\nOn the business process side, new IT systems often require employees to operate according to new processes.\\nThese may be difficult to learn, take training to execute correctly, or may even be resisted outright by employees who prefer the old way of doing business.\\nGetting the entire organization on board with the changes brought about by a new IT system is particularly difficult because top management is often not actively involved in making this transition.\\nIn addition to business process adjustments, tremendous technical hurdles need to be overcome in getting new IT systems operational.\\nThe amount of integration that needs to take place between disparate systems is often overwhelming.\\nWhen a firm switches to a new system without proper integration, the new system is often unable to perform all that was promised and sometimes even performs worse than the system it replaced.\\nEven when the employees are bought into the new process and all the technical hurdles are overcome, it is often a delicate balance to actually make the transition over to the new system.\\nThe second category of risk is that the more a firm relies on IT to make decisions and execute processes, the higher is the risk that any sort of IT problem, ranging from software glitches to power outages to viruses, can completely shut down a firm\\'s operations.\\nThese are serious risks that a firm must plan to face.\\nIT also poses a risk in that it tends to set processes in stone.\\nPerhaps a system allows a process to be executed only one way.\\nThen the firm settles into a pattern of always doing this process that way.\\nObviously, there are great efficiency benefits to this, but the firm also runs the risk that the process is not of the performance level of its competitors and that its systems make it difficult to change to newer, more effective processes.\\nEach of the major risk categories has its own mitigation strategies.\\nWith regard to implementing IT systems, keep three ideas in mind.\\nThe first is to install new IT systems in an incremental fashion rather than in a \"big bang\" approach.\\nThis allows a firm to limit the damage should things go wrong and to pinpoint problem areas during the installation process.\\nSecond, firms can run duplicate systems to make sure the new system is performing well.\\nBy this, we mean that the firm can keep its old system running at the same time the new one is running.\\nIf the new system runs into trouble or if the results seem too far off from the old one, the old system can be utilized as it still exists.\\nIn fact, even before the new system is actually executing, it can be simulating (in parallel with the existing system) all the actions it would take.\\nThese proposed actions can be monitored to test how the new system will perform when it is actually activated.\\nFinally, implement only the level of complexity that is needed.\\nIf certain capabilities or added complexities are unnecessary, they should be left out, as they can often increase the risk of the project without increasing the potential benefits.\\nIn essence, we want to tailor our IT systems to our supply chain needs, with risk reduction being one of those needs.\\nOn the operational side, mitigation strategies include data backup systems, systems running in parallel in case one should suffer a problem, and a range of security software products that can help keep a company\\'s systems safe.\\nIn addition, picking systems that have the flexibility to change if need be can be important.\\nIn addition to the sets of practical suggestions for each supply chain macro process discussed earlier, managers need to keep in mind several general ideas when they are making a decision regarding supply chain IT.\\nSelect an IT system that addresses the company\\'s key success factors.\\nEvery industry and even companies within an industry can have different key success factors.\\nBy key success factors, we mean the two or three elements that really determine whether or not a company is going to be successful.\\nIt is important to select supply chain IT systems that are able to give a company an advantage in the areas most crucial to its success.\\nFor instance, the ability to set inventory levels optimally is crucial in the PC business, where product life cycles are short and inventory becomes obsolete quickly.\\nHowever, inventory levels are not nearly as crucial for a chemical company, where demand is fairly stable and the product has a long life cycle.\\nFor the chemical company, the key to success depends more on utilization of the production facility.\\nGiven these success factors, a PC company might pick a package that is strong in setting inventory levels even if it is weak in maximizing utilization of production capacity.\\nHowever, the chemical company should choose a different product, one that excels at maximizing utilization even if its inventory components are not especially strong.\\nTake incremental steps and measure value.\\nSome of the worst IT disasters result when companies try to implement IT systems in a wide variety of processes at the same time and end up with their projects being failures (often called the \"big bang\" approach).\\nThe impact of these failures is amplified by the fact that many of a company\\'s processes are tied up in the same debugging cycle all at once, causing productivity to come to a standstill.\\nOne way to help ensure success of IT projects is to design them so that they have incremental steps.\\nFor instance, instead of installing a complete supply chain system across your company all at once, start first by getting your demand planning up and running and then move on to supply planning.\\nAlong the way, make sure each step is adding value through increases in the performance of the three macro processes.\\nThis incremental approach does not mean that one should not take a big-picture perspective (in fact, one must take a big-picture perspective) but rather that the big-picture perspective should be implemented in digestible pieces.\\nAlign the level of sophistication with the need for sophistication.\\nManagement must consider the depth to which an IT system deals with the firm\\'s key success factors.\\nThere is a trade-off between the ease of implementing a system and the system\\'s level of complexity.\\nTherefore, it is important to consider just how much sophistication a company needs to achieve its goals and then ensure that the system chosen matches that level.\\nErring on the less sophisticated side leaves the firm with a competitive weakness, whereas trying to be too sophisticated leads to a higher possibility of the entire system failing.\\nUse IT systems to support decision making, not to make decisions.\\nAlthough the software available today can make many supply chain decisions for management, this does not mean that IT applications can make all of the decisions.\\nA mistake companies can make is installing a supply chain system and then reducing the amount of managerial effort it spends on supply chain issues.\\nManagement must keep its focus on the supply chain because as the competitive and customer landscape changes, there needs to be a corresponding change in the supply chain.\\nThink about the future.\\nAlthough it is more difficult to make a decision about an IT system with the future rather than the present in mind, managers need to include the future state  .\\nof the business in the decision process.\\nIf trends in a company\\'s industry indicate that insignificant characteristics will become crucial in the future, managers need to make sure their IT choices take these trends into account.\\nAs IT systems often last for many more years than was originally planned, managers need to spend time exploring how flexible the systems will be if, or rather when, changes are required in the future.\\nThis exploration can go so far as to include the viability of the supply chain software developer itself.\\nIf it is unclear whether a company will be able to get support from a software company in the future, management needs to be sure that the other advantages of this product outweigh this disadvantage.\\nThe key here is to ensure that the software not only fits a company\\'s current needs but also, and even more important, that it will meet the company\\'s future needs.\\nUnderstand the importance of information and information technology in a supply chain.\\nInformation is essential to making good supply chain decisions because it provides the broad view needed to make optimal decisions.\\nIT provides the tools to gather this information and analyze it to make the best supply chain decisions.\\nKnow at a high level how each supply chain driver uses information.\\nEach of the supply chain drivers that we have discussed in previous chapters (facilities, inventory, transportation, sourcing, and pricing) requires information for decisions to be made.\\nInformation is the factual component on which decisions about each of the other drivers are based.\\nIn essence, information is the glue that holds the entire supply chain together and allows it to function, making information the most important supply chain driver.\\nUnderstand the major applications of supply chain information technology and the processes that they enable.\\nA company\\'s supply chain processes can be grouped into three main macro processes.\\nCRM includes processes that enable interaction between an enterprise and its customers.\\nISCM includes processes focused on the internal operations of an enterprise.\\nSRM includes processes that enable interaction between an enterprise and its suppliers.\\nIT enables these processes as well as the integration across these processes.\\nGood IT systems allow not only the collection of data across the supply chain, but also the analysis of decisions that maximize supply chain profitability.\\n Understand the importance of sustainability in a supply chain.\\nDiscuss the challenge to sustainability posed by the tragedy of the commons.\\nDescribe key metrics that can be used to measure sustainability for a supply chain.\\nIdentify opportunities for improved sustainability in various supply chain drivers.\\nSustainability has become a key priority in the design and operation of supply chains in the 21st century.\\nA focus on sustainability allows a supply chain to better serve more environmentally conscious customers while often improving supply chain performance.\\nIn this chapter, we explore the importance of sustainability, some challenges to designing and operating more sustainable supply chains, and the role of different supply chain drivers in improving sustainability.\\nThe focus on sustainability has increased as the economies in large countries such as Brazil, China, and India have grown.\\nOn the one hand, the growth of emerging markets is improving global living standards in a way that perhaps has not happened before in human history.\\nOn the other hand, this growth puts pressure on resources and 500  .\\nthe environment in a way that has also never happened.\\nIt has become increasingly clear that if supply chains do not become more sustainable than they have been in the past, the world\\'s resources and environment cannot maintain this level of growth.\\nThe factors driving an increased focus on sustainability can be divided into three distinct categories: 1.\\nReducing risk and improving the financial performance of the supply chain 2.\\nAttracting customers who value sustainability 3.\\nMaking the world more sustainable Even though there has been a lot of talk about all three categories, most concrete action has been observed in reducing risk for the supply chain and improving financial performance.\\nMuch less success has been driven by customer demand or the desire to make the world more sustainable.\\nIt is interesting to note that significant opportunity exists even if supply chains focus only on reducing risk and improving financial performance.\\nA McKinsey report focused on greenhouse gas emissions reported that \"Almost 40 percent of [greenhouse gas] abatement could be achieved at negative marginal costs, meaning that investing in these options would generate positive economic returns over their lifecycle.\"\\nWhile much needs to be done, many companies have reported success in improving sustainability.\\nUnilever, the Dutch-British consumer goods giant, has invested significant effort to help emerging economies such as Brazil and India wrestle with poverty, water scarcity, and climate change.\\nIn Brazil, the company helped tomato growers convert to drip irrigation to save water.\\nThe company sees almost half of its sales and the majority of its growth coming from emerging economies.\\nIt buys roughly \"10 percent of the world\\'s crops of tea and 30 percent of all spinach.\\n\"1 A focus on sustainability helps Unilever improve the environment and economic health of markets where it is likely to see most of its future growth, while simultaneously ensuring supply of products it needs to feed this growth.\\nWal-Mart started its focus on sustainability as a defensive move given the criticism it was taking from environmental activists.\\nThe company, however, has seen many benefits to the bottom line.\\nSwitching to more efficient light bulbs at its stores and adding skylights for natural light have helped significantly reduce its energy costs.\\nReducing packaging has helped reduce material costs and transportation costs.\\nAnother example is the redesign of the one-gallon milk jug by Wal-Mart and Costco to use less material and increase packing density during transportation.\\nEven though it took the public some time to accept the new design, the effort saved \"10 to 20 cents a gallon compared to old jugs.\\n\"2 Starbucks is another example of a company that has focused on sustainability for significant business reasons.\\nIn the late 1990s, the company realized that its growth plans could not be sustained without helping coffee growers increase their production in a sustainable manner.\\nThe company started its coffee and farmer equity (C.A.F.E.)\\npractices, which evaluate the sustainable production of coffee along four dimensions: product quality, economic accountability, social responsibility, and environmental leadership.\\nAccording to the company, \"the first two categories are prerequisites to participation in the program and ensure basic coffee quality and financial transparency, equity, and the viability of the coffee supply chain.\"\\nSocial responsibility measures the extent to which the working conditions are safe and humane.\\nEnvironmental leadership measures the actions that suppliers are taking to \"manage waste, protect water quality, conserve water and energy, preserve biodiversity and reduce agrochemical use.\"\\nApplicants are given \"preferred supplier\" status based on the score they achieve across the four categories.\\nPreferred suppliers get a pricing premium of $0.05 per pound and favorable contract terms.\\nThe company claims that it sourced 84 percent of its coffee in 2010 from sources that were \"third-party verified 1 \"Beyond the Green Corporation,\" Business Week, January 29, 2007.\\n2 \"Solution, or Mess?\\nA Milk Jug for a Green Earth,\" New York Times, June 30, 2008.  .\\nor certified through C.A.F.E.\\npractices, Fairtrade or another externally audited system.\"\\nBesides helping attract customers who care about sustainability, these efforts have helped Starbucks reduce supply risk and ensure an ongoing supply of high-quality coffee, the most critical input for its business.\\nSustainability has presented more of a challenge when it requires efforts that do not provide obvious return on investment for a company.\\nIn fact, customers themselves have not always backed up words about the importance of sustainability with a willingness to pay more for sustainable products.\\nIn a survey, business leaders identified insufficient return on investment, customers\\' unwillingness to pay a premium for green products, and difficulty evaluating sustainability across a product life cycle as the major barriers to an increased focus on sustainability.3 When the business rationale for an increased focus on sustainability is not clearly defined for individual firms, maintaining the focus needed for building more sustainable supply chains is much harder.\\nAs we discuss in the next section, one of the biggest challenges to building sustainable supply chains is that in the short to medium term, an improved focus on sustainability provides benefits that are shared but costs that may be local to a firm, whereas the current status quo provides benefits that are local to firms but a cost that is global.\\nIn an influential article, Hardin (1968) described the tragedy of the commons as a dilemma arising when the common good does not align perfectly with the good of individual entities.\\nIt is useful to study his example in somewhat greater detail.\\nConsider a pasture that is open to all herdsmen with cattle.\\nEach herdsman attempts to maximize his gain from this public asset.\\nWhen his cattle feed in the pasture, he gains from their growth and all the gains accrue only to him.\\nAny cost of overgrazing, however, is spread over all herdsmen whose cattle feed at the pasture.\\nThus, overgrazing by the cattle of any herdsman provides a positive utility of +1 for the herdsman but a negative utility of only a fraction of ?\\nfor the herdsman because the negative utility of ?\\nis spread over all herdsmen.\\nThus, each rational herdsman continues to increase his herd because the positive utility to him of adding another animal exceeds the negative utility that he experiences from over grazing.\\nAs Hardin writes, \"Therein is the tragedy.\\nEach man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit--in a world that is limited.\\nRuin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons.\\nFreedom in a commons brings ruin to all.\"\\nHardin then describes how the issue of environmental pollution is essentially the tragedy of the commons.\\nEvery individual and every company releases waste and pollution into the environment in the form of sewage, chemicals, and carbon dioxide.\\nThe individual or the company would incur the entire cost of reducing the amount of waste it discards, whereas the cost of throwing waste into the environment is shared by the entire world.\\nThe common environment available to all at no cost makes it difficult to get every company to invest in waste reduction efforts even though this waste hurts everybody.\\nThis issue also shows up at the country level.\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body that has been assessing global warming since 1990, has written that even though most of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has come from the United States and Western Europe, it is poorer countries closer to the equator that are likely to pay the biggest price.\\nThe risk of drought, disrupted water supplies, and the swelling of oceans from melting ice sheets as a result of global warming will mostly be experienced in Africa and the \"crowded river deltas in southern Asia and Egypt, along with small island nations.\\n\"4 In such an environment, getting any agreement on action is difficult because the optimal joint action is 3 \"Gibbs & Soell Survey,\" accessed on May 1, 2011, at www.cnbc.com/id/42432191/ 4 Revkin, Andrew C. \"Poor Nations to Bear Brunt as World Warms.\"\\nNew York Times, April 1, 2007.  .\\nnot individually optimal, whether at the company or country level.\\nNo wonder that it has been almost impossible to negotiate a climate change agreement that every country is willing to adhere to!\\nOther examples of the tragedy of the commons come from the overuse of natural resources such as fish, water, and forests.\\nOverfishing of sturgeon in Russia and the destruction of salmon runs in rivers that have been dammed are well documented.\\nEvery company and supply chain faces the challenge of the tragedy of the commons as it operates in a global environment.\\nThey must compete against others that may be extracting benefits from the environmental or resource commons without spending to maintain these commons.\\nThey must compete in a market where customers often value low cost and are not willing to pay the price of a more sustainable solution, either in the form of a higher price or reduced consumption.\\nUnless all consumers suddenly change their mind-set, it is difficult to imagine a sustainable solution emerging without some intervention.\\nWhereas everyone agrees about the need for intervention, there is considerable disagreement on the required form of intervention.\\nWhat Are Some Solutions to This \"Tragedy\"?\\nIn his article, Hardin focused on the problem arising from the fact that the commons are \"free\" to all.\\nAs he put it, no solution could be found without taking away some of the freedom that participants enjoyed in the commons.\\nRegarding the national parks in the United States, he wrote, \"We might sell them off as private property.\\nWe might keep them as public property, but allocate the right to enter them.\\nThe allocation might be on the basis of wealth, by the use of an auction system.\\nIt might be on the basis of merit, as defined by some agreed upon standards.\\nIt might be by lottery.\\nOr it might be on a first-come, first-served basis, administered to long queues.\\nThese, I think, are all objectionable.\\nBut we must choose--or acquiesce in the destruction of the commons that we call our National Parks.\"\\nRather than focus on Hardin\\'s many ideas, it is important to realize the point he makes is the need for us to choose from options that are unlikely to be supported by all of their own free will.\\nIn the article, Hardin introduces the idea of \"mutual coercion,\" whereby social arrangements or mechanisms coerce all participants to behave in a way that helps the common good.\\nMutual coercion can be attempted through a command-and-control approach or market mechanisms.\\nIn a command-and-control approach, the government or regulators set standards that everybody must adhere to.\\nAn example is carbon monoxide emission standards set by the United States for new automobiles.\\nAnother example is the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive from the European Union that is geared at proper recycling and landfill avoidance in the electrical and electronics industry.\\nThe challenge with command-and-control approaches is that they tend to be inflexible and rarely cost effective.\\nWe give a couple of examples of market mechanisms that have been debated (but not yet implemented in the United States as of October 2011!)\\nin the context of greenhouse gases, a problem that is only getting worse as supply chains become more global.\\nCurrently, there is no \"charge\" for emitting greenhouse gases and no explicit limits that are strictly enforced.\\nThe commons here is the environment, and the lack of any \"mutual coercion\" leads to excessive emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\\nThe hope is to set mechanisms in place that can sustainably address the problem.\\nOne mechanism has been referred to as \"cap-and-trade,\" which constrains the aggregate emissions by creating a limited number of tradeable emission allowances that emission sources must secure and surrender in proportion to their emissions.\\nAny failure to surrender the appropriate number of allowances leads to a significant fine.\\nThe mechanism starts with the government creating a limited number of total allowances that are distributed among all players in the economy.\\nIf players generate fewer emissions than the allowances they own, they can sell their surplus allowances to others that may be polluting above their limit and need additional allowances.\\nThe \"price\" of allowances in this mechanism will be created by the supply and demand for allowances.\\nSuch a mechanism offers companies an incentive to reduce their emissions because they get a financial reward for this improvement by selling their additional allowances to those  .\\nthat cannot (or are unable to) reduce their emissions.\\nThe hope with this mechanism is that firms will choose the least expensive way to comply with the emissions limit by either implementing emissions reduction plans or buying allowances on the open market.\\nThis mechanism has several challenges, however.\\nThe first relates to the method that is used to evaluate the initial allowances awarded to each entity.\\nShould they be in proportion to current pollution levels or desired pollution levels?\\nHow are the desired pollution levels to be calculated?\\nHow should the fine be evaluated if a company is not able to provide allowances for its emissions in a given year?\\nA second mechanism to control emissions is an emission tax.\\nEach entity generating greenhouse gases is charged a tax proportional to the size of the emissions.\\nThis is similar in principle to the congestion-based toll we discussed to manage traffic congestion (see Chapter 14).\\nA charge for emissions will encourage companies to reduce their emissions using all ideas whose marginal costs is less than the charge.\\nAs a result of an emission tax, the total amount of greenhouse gases produced will decrease.\\nThis mechanism has several challenges as well.\\nWhat should this charge for emissions be?\\nTo what extent will the charge hurt the economy?\\nAnswers to each question have a significant impact on the performance of either mechanism.\\nThere is still considerable debate among experts on each issue, given the uncertainty in being able to estimate the cost to society from these emissions.\\nThe significant challenge of whether these mechanisms can be implemented at the country level or need to be coordinated globally still exists.\\nThis is a particularly important issue given that most of the existing emissions have come from the developed world, whereas with global growth, an increasing share of future emissions is likely to come from economies that are still developing.\\nAs we mentioned earlier many actions taken in a supply chain can improve both sustainability and supply chain surplus.\\nFor example, the use of modular design by IKEA allows the company to tightly pack its parts when they are shipped from the production location to its retail stores.\\nModular design allows the company to simultaneously reduce emissions as well as its transportation costs.\\nSC Johnson, a manufacturer of cleaning supplies and other consumer goods, has reported that between 1990 and 1999 the company used its eco-efficiency efforts to cut more than 420 million pounds of waste and save $125 million.\\nIn scenarios like these, in which sustainability improvements also improve the financial performance of the supply chain, one can focus on financial metrics to evaluate sustainability efforts.\\nThe majority of sustainability-related efforts, however, have a cost that the supply chain incurs for a benefit that may be more universal.\\nIn such situations, defining explicit metrics that can be used to judge sustainability-related efforts in the supply chain is important.\\nIn this section, we identify some important categories and metrics that supply chains can focus on.\\nA look at various corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports shows some commonality but also a lot of divergence in terms of the metrics they chose to report.\\nAll companies report some social and environmental metrics.\\nA large variation exists, however, in terms of the precise metrics reported.\\nFor example, transportation companies tend to report on greenhouse emissions, fuel consumption, and transportation efficiency whereas pharmaceutical firms have a greater focus on waste management and water consumption.\\nFrom an environmental perspective, all firms should measure and report on these four categories: 1.\\nEnergy consumption 2.\\nGreenhouse gas emissions 4.\\nWaste generation Two fundamental challenges exist in a supply chain in the measurement and reporting of the four categories.\\nThe first challenge relates to the scope over which a category is measured.\\nConsider a company that reports only energy consumption within its own operations.\\ndecides to outsource some production to an offshore supplier, its own energy consumption will show a decline even though the energy consumption in the entire supply chain may have increased.\\nIf it decides to bring some production in-house and onshore, the energy consumption within its operations will show an increase even if the energy consumption for the entire supply chain has decreased.\\nThus, it is important to clearly define the scope across which all metrics are measured and reported.\\nIn the context of greenhouse gas emission, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) initiative5 defines three scope levels.\\nScope 1 refers to emissions from GHG sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity, also referred to as direct emissions.\\nScope 2 refers to indirect emissions from grid-sourced electricity and other utility services including heat, steam, and cooling.\\nScope 3 refers to the inclusion of other indirect emissions coming from the production of purchased materials, outsourced activities, contractor-owned vehicles, waste disposal, and employee business travel.\\nFor most firms, the extent of direct emissions is typically only a small fraction of the extent of indirect emissions in the supply chain.\\nFor example, a detailed analysis by the pharmaceutical company Abbott indicated that its indirect emissions were about 6 to 14 times its direct emissions.\\nIdeally, all categories should be measured across the entire supply chain from the consumer to the lowest tier supplier to capture the full impact of the supply chain on the environment.\\nThe second challenge in measurement and reporting relates to the use of absolute or relative measures of performance.\\nAn absolute measure reports the total amount of energy consumption, whereas a relative measure may report the energy consumed per unit of output.\\nThe advantage of using an absolute measure is that it reports the full impact of the supply chain (assuming we use scope 3) along the category being measured.\\nThe disadvantage is that a drop in supply chain sales and production (e.g., in a downturn) will show an improved absolute measure of energy consumption even though the company may not have changed anything.\\nA relative measure of performance is more effective at capturing improvement.\\nThe challenge with using a relative measure is the choice of basic unit because each category can be measured relative to dollars of sales, kilograms of output, or a variety of other units.\\nIn general, it is better for firms to measure and report both absolute and relative measures to get a true picture of their performance.\\nOpportunities for improving supply chain sustainability can be identified by matching the four categories we have described (energy consumption, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation) with the various supply chain drivers discussed in the book.\\nThe goal is for every firm to measure its environmental impact for each driver along each of the four categories.\\nIn this section, we discuss some of the opportunities available for each driver and provide some examples.\\nFacilities Facilities tend to be significant consumers of energy and water and emitters of waste and greenhouse gases and thus offer significant opportunities for profitable improvement.\\nOnce a firm measures the direct impact of each facility in terms of energy, water, emissions, and waste, it should separate the improvement opportunities into those that generate positive cash flows and those that do not.\\nSuccessful companies start by identifying and implementing the profitable projects first.\\nAccording to its 2011 CSR report, Walmart has designed and opened a viable store prototype that is up to 25 to 30 percent more energy efficient and produces up to 30 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2005 baseline.\\nUsing more energy efficient light bulbs and building skylights for natural light has cut energy consumption at its existing stores.\\nWalmart has also worked to convert waste management at its stores from a cost to a profit 5 Accessed on May 2, 2011, from www.ghgprotocol.org/.\\nThe company reported that in California, more than 80 percent of waste has been diverted from landfills and recycled to produce revenue.\\nAnother example of profitable improvement comes from using technology to balance the peak load for energy across a chain of convenience stores.\\nBy suitably staggering the time that air conditioners and freezers at its stores are turned on, the chain can reduce the peak demand for energy across the store network, resulting in lower costs for the chain and a reduced demand for peak load in the grid.\\nProduction facilities often have significant opportunity to reuse heat energy generated and reduce water usage during the process.\\nCoca-Cola has worked hard to reuse heat energy from boilers in its production process and reduce its total water footprint.\\nLee (2010) gives the example of Posco, which worked with its equipment supplier, Siemens VAI, to create a new production process that cut costs and emissions without hurting product quality by using local iron ore that was of lower quality but less expensive.\\nAs a result, Posco reduced the cost of a new mill by 6 percent to 17 percent and decreased its operating costs by 15 percent while producing lower levels of greenhouse gases and other waste.\\nAs these examples illustrate, facilities often offer the best opportunity to simultaneously improve the environmental and financial performances through innovation.\\nInventory Most supply chains focus on raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventory as we have in this book, but few focus on the inventory sitting in a typical landfill.\\nWhile the inventory in the landfill may not show up in a firm\\'s balance sheet, it does show up as one of the most damaging aspects from a sustainability perspective.\\nThe damage may be in the form of harmful additives or in the form of valuable energy and materials that are still locked in the landfill.\\nArguably, the most significant waste in any supply chain occurs when a product is thrown into the landfill because both materials and energy used to produce the product are now lost forever, potentially doing harm.\\nThe goal of every supply chain should be to track its landfill inventory and separate it in terms of harmful additives and unused value.\\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to assess the environmental impacts associated with a product\\'s life from cradle to grave.\\nThe goal should be to reduce (or at least limit) the harmful inventory and unlock the unused value in products when they are discarded.\\nMcDonough and Braungart (2002) discuss the importance of \"cradle to cradle\" design if we are to truly limit the landfill inventory generated by a supply chain.\\nThey suggest designing products \"that, when their useful life is over, do not become useless waste but can be tossed onto the ground to decompose and become food for plants and animals and nutrients for soil; or, alternately, they can return to industrial cycles to supply high quality raw materials for new products.\"\\nWalmart, for example, reduced the amount of harmful phosphates in laundry and dish detergents in the Americas by 14.5 percent in 2011, with a goal of reaching a reduction of 70 percent.\\nThe company also redesigned packaging to eliminate 91 percent of jewelry pallets and make all its jewelry boxes from recycled materials.\\nTransportation Transportation is another driver wherein firms are likely to find several positive cash flow opportunities.\\nAny supply chain design innovation that lowers transportation costs also tends to reduce emissions and waste generated from transportation.\\nIn its 2011 CSR report, Walmart reported that in the United States, it decreased the amount of fuel used to deliver a case of product by 65 percent between 2005 and 2010.\\nThis improvement through increased aggregation, a more efficient loading of transportation vehicles, and an increase in their fuel efficiency cuts both cost as well as environmental damage.\\nLee (2010) cites four companies--HewlettPackard, Electrolux, Sony, and Braun--that have formed a joint venture, the European Recycling Platform, to gain better economies of scale in their recycling efforts.\\nLee reports that HP\\'s cost of recycling digital cameras is only 1 or 2 euro cents in countries with the environmental platform compared to 7 euro cents to 1.24 euros in countries without the platform.\\nProduct design can also play a significant role in reducing transportation cost and emissions by reducing packaging and allowing greater density during transportation.\\nIKEA has always worked hard to design products that can be shipped flat to achieve high volume and weight density during transportation.\\nAs a result, the company not only lowers its transportation costs, it also reduces emissions and energy use.\\nSourcing For most firms, the majority of energy and water use and waste and emissions occurs in the extended supply chain outside their own enterprise.\\nThus, to truly have an impact on sustainability, powerful players must look at the extended supply chain and work with their suppliers to improve performance.\\nAs we have mentioned earlier, the C.A.F.E.\\nprogram at Starbucks encourages suppliers to improve their environmental and social responsibility scores by providing a price premium.\\nWalmart and IKEA have also set aggressive targets for their suppliers to improve overall supply chain sustainability.\\nFailure to work with suppliers on sustainability should also be viewed as a potential source of risk that can cause considerable damage to the reputation and sales of a firm.\\nThe presence of lead paint in some of its most popular toys forced Mattel to recall hundreds of thousands of toys sold between April and July of 2007.6 Verifying and tracking supplier performance with regard to sustainability, however, continues to be a major challenge for most firms.\\nThis effort has become more difficult as supply chains have become increasingly global and fragmented.\\nInformation Good information continues to be one of the biggest challenges to improved supply chain sustainability.\\nThe absence of standards for measurement and reporting has led to claims of improvement that are often not verifiable.\\nIn the short term, this has led to company-specific standards and an explosion of certifications and certifying agencies.\\nCompanies talk of working toward a common set of standards, but it is unlikely that such standards will emerge because incentives are not aligned across different firms.\\nThis poses a challenge both within firms and across supply chains when it comes to improving sustainability.\\nstandards and supplier rating are an effort by Starbucks to encourage suppliers to focus on sustainability.\\nPlambeck (2007) describes efforts within Walmart to measure and motivate both suppliers and associates.\\nTo reduce packaging, Walmart implemented a Web-based scorecard that evaluated the packaging of each product along nine metrics such as cube utilization and recycled content.\\nThis scorecard was used to measure and recognize improvements in packaging.\\nEven though universal standards may not be possible, the use of consistent scorecards within a supply chain can go a long way toward aligning the sustainability efforts of all members of the extended supply chain.\\nPricing Consumption visibility and differential pricing by load or time of day have the potential to make a significant difference in the usage of energy by consumers.\\nSome studies have found that when people can see how much electricity they are using and the impact of turning off different appliances, their usage decreases by between 10 to 15 percent.\\nIf this visibility is simultaneously coupled with lower price off-peak electricity, there is a potential to reduce peak load demand.\\nIn general, increasing the visibility of the environmental impact of products can help customers make more informed choices, especially when the sustainable option costs more.\\nOne of the biggest challenges to improved sustainability of a supply chain is changing the customer\\'s willingness to pay for a product that is produced and distributed by a supply chain in a more sustainable manner but ends up costing more.\\nEven a company such as Walmart, which is focused on improved sustainability, has not hit its targets for the use of renewable energy because 6 Story, Louise, \"Lead Paint Prompts Mattel to Recall 967,000 Toys.\"\\nNew York Times, August 2, 2007.  .\\nthese sources have higher costs compared to other sources of energy.\\nIn the short term, government incentives supporting some sustainable products can help.\\nFor example, in 2011, the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle qualified for a federal tax credit of $7,500 in the United States.\\nIn the long term, however, sustainability cannot be improved in a supply chain simply by focusing on reducing costs or the use of incentives.\\nThe efforts toward increased sustainability will pick up greater speed once customers place greater value on it, allowing supply chains to grow the supply chain surplus by being sustainable.\\nAs we have discussed earlier, supply chains typically cause significant harm to the environment when their output ends up in a landfill.\\nOne of the biggest opportunities to improve sustainability is for firms to design products that can be reused and recycled.\\nIn practice, it is not sufficient to design a recyclable product.\\nThe product has to be supported by a supply chain that ensures recycling.\\nWithout the support of the supply chain, even products that can be recycled end up in the landfill!\\nIn this section, we raise some challenges in developing closed-loop supply chains that can profitably take back product from customers and recover value by reusing the entire product or some part of it.\\nGuide and Van Wassenhove (2009) provide an excellent discussion of closed-loop supply chains.\\nGuide and Van Wassenhove describe three scenarios wherein a supply chain may handle returns.\\nIn the first, a customer returns a product either because it is defective or because he or she has decided during the return period that the product is not needed.\\nIf the product is defective, the supply chain has to be able to perform any light repair (which may be as simple as cleaning) and reintroduce it into the market.\\nWhen a customer has used the product over its useful life and is ready to throw it away, the product is either trashed or can be picked up by the supply chain.\\nTrashing the product hurts the environment.\\nEven if the product is returned to the supply chain, several issues need to be addressed if environmental gains are to be realized.\\nSome of the returned parts can potentially be remanufactured and used in making other products.\\nThe other parts will need to be successfully recycled.\\nThe following three pairings result: Consumer returns are to be repaired, end-of use returns are to be remanufactured, and end-of-life returns are to be recycled for sustainability.\\nBesides any technical challenges of performing each task, one of the most significant challenges is to design products and supply chains in which these tasks can be performed economically.\\nIn fact, many cities in the United States (including New York) cut back their recycling efforts in the early part of the 21st century because the cost of recycling was high and the market for recycled products was weak.\\nWhether products are to be repaired, remanufactured, or recycled, the economic interests of all the parties involved must be understood and aligned for the activities to be performed.\\nFor example, does a company gain or lose economically by selling remanufactured products along with new ones?\\nHow can a firm ensure sufficient access to used products if it plans to remanufacture?\\nWho should be responsible for collecting used products (the retailer, the manufacturer, or a third party)?\\nWhat incentives need to be in place for the economic interests of the entire supply chain to be aligned in such a setting?\\nDo any decisions change if the product has a short or long life cycle?\\nAnother issue arises with regard to the design of durable components if they are to be remanufactured.\\nSuppliers often have little interest in increasing durability of components because that may cut back on the sales of their own products.\\nWhat incentives need to be in place for them to design and produce durable products?\\nThe answers to these questions determine the extent to which supply chains will be sustainable.\\nUnderstand the importance of sustainability in a supply chain.\\nAs supply chains have globalized and emerging countries have grown, it has become increasingly clear that the world\\'s resources and environment will not be able to support this growth unless supply chains  .\\nbecome more sustainable.\\nBesides the need to make the world more sustainable, an increased focus on sustainability has allowed some supply chains to reduce risk, become more efficient, and also attract some customers who value these efforts.\\nDiscuss the challenge to sustainability posed by the tragedy of the commons.\\nMany actions that improve sustainability of a supply chain impose costs that are local (to an individual, a firm, supply chain, or country) but provide common benefits that are more global.\\nIn contrast, a disregard for sustainability provides benefits that are local but costs that are shared globally.\\nAs a result, encouraging sustainability without some external pressure either in the form of a public mandate or economic incentive can be difficult.\\nDescribe key metrics that can be used to measure sustainability for a supply chain.\\nSupply chain sustainability can be measured in terms of energy consumption, water consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and waste generation.\\nIt is important that these metrics be tracked across as wide a scope of the supply chain as possible.\\nIdentify opportunities for improved sustainability in various supply chain drivers.\\nFacilities can be redesigned to reduce both energy use and emissions.\\nProducts should be designed with a \"cradle to cradle\" philosophy to decrease landfill inventory and increase the reuse of material.\\nDesigning products to limit packaging and improve transportation density helps reduce costs as well as emissions during transportation.\\nGiven that any one firm is only a small fraction of a supply chain\\'s impact on the environment, it is critical that powerful players work with the extended supply chain to improve sustainability.\\nClearly defined standards for measurement and reporting of performance are important if sustainability is to improve across supply chains.\\nFinally, a significant driver of improved sustainability will be customers\\' willingness to reward successful supply chains.\\n'"
